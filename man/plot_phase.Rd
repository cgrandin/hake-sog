\arguments{
\item{model}{A model, created by \code{\link[=create_rds_file]{create_rds_file()}}}

\item{start_yr}{The minimum year in the plot}

\item{end_yr}{The maximum year in the plot}

\item{x_lim}{Vector of two values for minimum and maximum x-axis values}

\item{y_lim}{Vector of two values for minimum and maximum y-axis values}

\item{biomass_scale}{Amount to divide biomass by so the axis has small nums}

\item{init_lbl_x_off}{Initial year label x offset in units of axis}

\item{init_lbl_y_off}{Initial year label y offset in units of axis}

\item{final_lbl_x_off}{Final year label x offset in units of axis}

\item{final_lbl_y_off}{Final year label y offset in units of axis}

\item{detail_b40_outliers}{Shade the part of the plot less that B40,
plot the missing points at the lower 2.5\% of the depletion distribution,
draw a box around those points and show a label with the description}

\item{detail_fspr_outliers}{Shade the part of the plot greater than
FSPR = 1, plot the missing points at the upper 2.5\% of the FSPR
distribution, draw a box around those points and show a label with the
description}

\item{show_joint_prob_points}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, show jittered points
near the X and Y points and a scatterplot in the upper left corner showing
where the joint probabilities are \code{TRUE}}

\item{joint_point_color}{If \code{show_joint_prob_points} is \code{TRUE}, this is
the color of those points}
