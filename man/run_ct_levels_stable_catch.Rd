\arguments{
\item{model}{The SS model output as loaded by \code{\link[=create_rds_file]{create_rds_file()}}}

\item{forecast_yrs}{A vector of forecast years}

\item{ss_exe}{The name of executable to use or \code{NULL} to use the package
data variable \link{ss_executable}}

\item{keep_files}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, keep all files in the directory,
if \code{FALSE} delete all files except for the filename contained in the
