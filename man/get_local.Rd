\title{Load an object from an \code{.Rdat} file}
\usage{
get_local(file, dir = file.path(hakedata_wd(), "extractedData"))
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A file path for either an existing file or
a file that will be written to the disk by the given
function. Paths can be either full or relative.}

\item{dir}{The path to a directory.}
}
\description{
Create a file path from \code{dir} and \code{file} using \code{\link[=file.path]{file.path()}} and
load the object into the local environment while returning it.
\code{get_local()} assumes that there is only one object in the \code{.Rdat} file.
The utility of this function comes from being able to quickly load
an R object that was saved as an \code{.Rdat} into a function argument without
having to save it in your work space.
