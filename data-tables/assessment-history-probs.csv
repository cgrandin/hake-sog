# Year - assessment year, t.
# P_decline - that assessment's % estimate of P(B_t+1 < B_t | known catch).
#  Use the known catch for year t (calculated for the t+1 assessment), look at year t's
#  assessment decision table (Table i) and use the closest catch to the now known
#  catch, or interpolate, to give P(B_t+1 < B_t | known catch), i.e. the prob
#  of the stock declining from t to t+1 given a catch based on what we know the
#  catch in year t to have been.
# P_below_B40 - similarly, give that assessment's estimate of P(B_t+1 < B_40% | known catch).
# The actual probabilities of these events will then be calculated based on most recent assessment.
# Each assessment cycle
#  - check if historical catches have been updated from previous year and if necessary update
#    these probs (unlikely historical catches would change enough for this to be necessary)
#  - add the row for last year's assessment, given we now know last year's catch
# Notes on catches used, if not obvious:
# 2012 - 207,203 actual, options were 200,000 and 251,809, so go about 14% of the difference.
#   Note that probsin 2012 assessment are given opposite way round to future assessments, corrected for here.
# 2013 - 285,828 actual, options were 250,000 and 300,000, so 70% of the difference
# 2014 - 299,259 actual, options were 275,000 and 325,000, so go midway
# 2015 - 193,844 actual, options were 180,000 and 300,000, so about 10% of the difference.
# 2016 - 332,070 actual
# 2017 - 440,950 actual, options were 350,00 and 497,500, so 3/5 from 350,000, interpolate
# 2018 - 413,719 actual, options were 350,000 and 440,000, so 2/3 from 350,000, interpolate.
# 2019 - 411,574 actual, use 410,000
# 2020 - 379,270 actual, use halfway between 350,000 and 410,000
# 2021 - 326,629 actual (approx), each 30,000 was about 1% change in P_decline and 2% in P_below_B40
# 2022 - 320,224 actual, use option e (320,000) from 2022 assessment. For 2024 assessment the 2022 catch got updated to 323,372, so closer to option f (325,000), but probs are the same so all good
# 2023 - 263,981 actual, use 270,000 option d from 2023 assessment.
# 2024 - 170,850 actual, use 180,000 option b from 2024 assessment.
