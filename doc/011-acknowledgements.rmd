# Acknowledgments {#sec:acknowledgments}

We thank the authors of previous assessments whose work remains an influential
part of this assessment. We are grateful for the hard work of the U.S. and
Canadian acoustics teams, including (in alphabetical order)
Alicia Billings,
Julia Clemons,
Steve Deblois,
St√©phane Gauthier,
Elizabeth Phillips,
John Pohl,
Chelsea Stanley,
Rebecca Thomas, and
Amanda Vitale,
as well as the crews of the NOAA ship *Bell Shimada*,
the Canadian Coast Guard Ship *CCGS Sir John Franklin*,
and the fishing vessel *Nordic Pearl*.
We thank the following individuals who contributed technical
assistance, analysis tools, data, or comments to this and/or previous
assessments:

Erin Steiner,
Brad Stenberg,
Ian Taylor (who once again gave insightful comments on a draft version),
Jim Thorson,
Vanessa Tuttle,
Audrey Ty,
Eric Ward,
and contributions by many others that are too numerous to list here. We also
thank the attendees at the official JTC meeting who provided valuable insight
into the `r end_yr - 1` commercial fisheries in Canada and the U.S., as well
as additional perspective on the acoustic survey and `r sp` related research.
We appreciate the input from the AP (particularly for providing
Appendices~\@ref(sec:app-canada-fishery-report)
and \@ref(sec:app-us-fishery-report)) and other industry representatives as
well as the JMC members. We would also like to thank the U.S. mothership
sector for providing access to their data in such a timely manner and Vanessa
Tuttle, Stephanie Johnson, Erin Steiner, Kayleigh Somers, Kate Richerson, Owen
Hamel, and Kristin Marshall for conversations and actions that facilitated the
exchange.

We thank all the members of the Scientific Review Group for their thoughtful
review and smoothly run SRG meeting, including co-chairs
Owen Hamel and Steven Schut,
panel members
Trevor Branch,
Jaclyn Cleary,
<!-- Will White, -->
Allan Hicks,
Sam Johnson,
and AP advisors
Shannon Mann and
Lori Steele.

Finally, we are very thankful for the Treaty coordinator, Colin Sayre, for
handling logistics related to Treaty communications and meetings.

We thank the Stock Synthesis, the \texttt{r4ss} R package, and the
\texttt{adnuts} R package development teams for continually improving stock
assessment tools used in this assessment. Calculations and figures from Stock
Synthesis output were performed using `r R.Version()$version.string`. Many
R [@RCoreTeam] packages were used to produce this document (in particular
\texttt{bookdown}, \texttt{rmarkdown}, \texttt{knitr}, and \texttt{adnuts})

Having all of the code under \texttt{git} version control has greatly
increased the collaboration between authors. It has been in use since the
2016 assessment [@JTC2016] and has ensured delivery of the assessment document
each year within a contracted time frame.
