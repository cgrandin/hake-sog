There are many research projects and data collections that could improve
the stock assessment for `r sp` and lead to improved biological understanding
and decision-making. The following is a list of needs (new and ongoing) that the
JTC has identified as having a high probability of improving the overall
quality and robustness of the stock assessment.  Only the top three are shown
in the executive summary.

1. Continue to conduct research to evaluate ways to improve recent, current,
and future estimates of recruitment for use in stock assessment. This could
include the development of time series of recruitment indices, time series of
informative environmental or ecosystem variables, and models that have
predictive skill [e.g., @VestfalsEtAl2023]. Explorations should also consider
options for incorporating information on recruitment into the assessment model
and the management framework for `r sp`. For example, time series could be
included in the stock assessment as a standalone data source (similar to the
acoustic indices) or improvements could be made to the modeling framework
such that these environmental time series could impact the stock--recruitment
relationship directly. Results from such work should be connected to or in
cooperation with ongoing research related to recruitment variability as discussed
in Section~\@ref(sec:assessment-response-review). Related, there is a need to
streamline and broaden the availability of products from oceanographic models
(e.g., Regional Ocean Modeling System) so they are available across
international boundaries and updated on a recurring basis, thereby allowing for
their use as informative links in operational stock assessments. A successful
example of this has been the annual production of `r sp` distribution forecasts
that depend on 6--9 month forecasts of subsurface (i.e., 100 m depth)
temperature from [J-SCOPE](http://www.nanoos.org/products/j-scope/home.php).
The continued collection of annual histological samples across ages, and the associated
resources to complete the histological laboratory work, is needed
to inform time-varying maturity in the assessment model.
Furthermore, the existing management strategy evaluation framework should be
used, or further developed, to examine how information on recruitment can
inform robust management decisions.

2. Conduct research on current and future index of abundance data sets
or species distribution models that provide new age-based (e.g.,
recruitment or population-wide) or spatial population structure and
distribution information to the stock assessment.  In particular,
continue to explore the utility of eDNA-based spatiotemporal biomass indices
of population abundance. Develop species distribution models for `r sp`
that utilize ecosystem information as drivers of observations across
spatiotemporal domains. Investigate alternative ways to utilize survey
age-composition information in the assessment model. Develop estimates of
uncertainty for the relative age-1 index and test performance for furture use.
Broaden the scope of
uncertainty considered in the age-2$+$ index and adjust for changes arising
from the U.S. Integrated Survey Initiative. Bootstrapping of the
acoustic survey time series, or related methods, could help incorporate
uncertainty related to the target-strength relationship, subjective scoring of
echograms, thresholding methods, and methods used to estimate the species mixes
for interpreting the acoustic backscatter into the variance calculations.
Research should be communicated with those involved in developing the U.S. West
Coast Integrated Survey Initiative. The management strategy evaluation
framework should be used, or further developed, to examine how changes in
survey methods can be used to inform robust management decisions.

3. Continue to develop value-added scientific products to complement the stock
assessment for management decision-making. In particular, work with regional
partners to develop risk tables or other annual workflows that provides key
metrics, indicators, or other summaries of general ecosystem conditions relevant
to the coast-wide population of `r sp`.  It would be advantageous to include
indicators that are potentially associated with `r sp` biology and ecology (e.g.,
recruitment, distribution, predation, prey, and communities). Such information can
broaden the context within which a single species stock assessment is interpreted,
be used to support model development, refine uncertain assessment conclusions
(e.g., productivity), and provide other non-assessment indicators of the
system's state to management.
