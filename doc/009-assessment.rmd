# Assessment {#sec:assessment}

## Modeling history {#sec:assessment-modeling-history}

In spite of the relatively short history of fishing, `r sp` have surely been
subject to a larger number of stock assessments than any other marine species off the
west coast of the U.S.~and Canada. These assessments have included a large
variety of age-structured models. Initially, a cohort analysis tuned to fishery
CPUE was used [@FrancisSwartzmanEtAl1982]. Later, the cohort analysis was
tuned to National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) triennial acoustic survey
estimates of absolute biomass-at-age [@HollowedAdlersteinEtAl1988].
Since 1989, Stock Synthesis models (or base versions of it) fit to
fishery catch-at-age data and acoustic survey estimates of population biomass
and age composition have been the primary assessment method.

While the general form of the age-structured assessment has remained similar
since 1991, modeling procedures have been modified in a variety of ways. There
have been alternative data choices, post-data collection processing routines,
data-weighting schemes, structural assumptions for the stock assessment model,
MCMC sampling algorithms, and control rules
(Table~\@ref(tab:main-assessment-changes-tab)). Analysts are constantly trying to
improve the caliber and relevance of the assessment by responding to new
scientific developments related to statistics and biological dynamics, policy
requirements, and different or new insights brought up during the peer review
process to ensure a robust stock assessment.

Data processing, filtering, and weighting choices have been modified several
times since the first assessment. For example, modifications to the
target-strength relationship used to scale acoustic data changed in 1997
[@DornSaunders1997], and kriging was implemented to account for the spatial
correlation in the acoustic data in 2010 [@StewartHamel2010]. While survey
data have been the key index for biomass since 1988, surveys that have been
used have varied considerably. The Alaska Fisheries Science Center/Northwest
Fisheries Science Center West Coast Triennial Shelf Survey was used from 1988
before being discarded from the 2009 assessment [@HamelStewart2009]. Acoustic
surveys from the years prior to 1995 were used for assessments in the early
1990s, but @StewartForrestEtAl2011 reviewed these early surveys and deemed
that sampling was insufficient to be comparable with more recent data. Several
recruitment indices have been considered but ultimately none were identified
as adding appreciable contribution to model results [@HelserDornEtAl2002;
@HelserFleischerEtAl2005; @StewartHamel2010], except for the
fishery-independent acoustic-based relative age-1 index that was included
in the base model in the 2022-2024 assessments and removed in the final bridging
step this year. The process for generating
fecundity-at-age from the combination of weight-at-age and maturity data changed
in 2019 from using time-invariant to year-specific weight-at-age values. In 2024,
time-varying maturity ogives were also added to the calculation of fecundity-at-age
(see Section~\@ref(sec:data-maturity) for details). Even where data have
been consistently used, the weighting of these data in the statistical likelihood
has changed through the use of various emphasis factors [e.g., @Dorn1994;
@DornSaundersEtAl1999], a multinomial sample size on age compositions [e.g.,
@DornSaundersEtAl1999; @HelserDornEtAl2002; @HelserFleischerEtAl2005;
@StewartForrestEtAl2011], internal estimations of effective sample size using
the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution [@JTC2018], and assumptions regarding
year-specific survey variance. Since 2021, a more computationally efficient
Bayesian MCMC sampler [No-U-Turn Sampler; NUTS; @HoffmanGelman2014] was used
to estimate posterior distributions [@Monnahan2018; @Monnahan2019], a change
from previous assessments that used the random walk Metropolis Hastings (rwMH)
sampler [details described in @JTC2021]. The list of changes discussed above
is for illustrative purposes only and represents a small fraction of the
different choices analysts have made and that reviewers have requested.

The structure of the assessment models has perhaps had the largest number of
changes. In terms of spatial models, analysts have considered
spatially explicit forms [@Dorn1994; @Dorn1997], spatially implicit forms
[@HelserStewartEtAl2006], and single-area models [@JTC2012]. Predicted
recruitment has been modeled by sampling historical recruitment [e.g.,
@Dorn1994; @HelserFleischerEtAl2005], using a stock--recruitment
relationship parameterized using maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and
the fishing mortality rate estimated to produce the MSY [`r f_msy`;
@Martell2010], and using several alternative steepness priors [@JTC2012;
@JTC2013]. Selectivity has also been modeled in several ways, invariant
[@JTC2012; @JTC2013], time-varying with [@HelserDornEtAl2002] and without
[@Dorn1994; @DornSaunders1997; @JTC2012; @JTC2013] a random walk,
alternative levels of allowable deviation through time [@JTC2013; @JTC2017],
age-based [@Dorn1994; @DornSaunders1997; @JTC2012; @JTC2013], and length-based
[@HelserMartell2007].

Several harvest control rules have been explored for providing catch limits
from stock assessment output. `r sp` stock assessments have presented decision
makers with constant *F*, variable *F*, and the following
hybrid control rules: `r fspr_35`, `r fspr_40`, `r f_40_40_10`, `r fspr_45`,
`r f_45_40_10`, and `r fspr_50` [e.g., @Dorn1996; @JTC2013]. Changes to
policies such as the United States' National Standards Guidelines in
2002 and the `r f_40_40_10` harvest control rule in the Agreement
(Appendix~\@ref(sec:app-glossary)) have required specific changes to control
rules.

In addition to the examples given above and changes documented in stock
assessments, there have been many more investigations conducted at review
panel meetings. Starting in 2013, the addition of the MSE [@JTC2013;
@JacobsenEtAl2021] facilitated investigating changes to the modeling
procedure in terms of pre-specified objectives that aim for a sustainable
coast-wide fishery.

## Description of base model {#sec:assessment-base-model}

The `r assess_yr` base model has the same general population dynamics structure as the
`r last_assess_yr` assessment's base model. The statistical-catch-at-age model
assumes that the `r sp` population is a single coast-wide stock subject to
one aggregated fleet with combined male and female population dynamics. Stock
Synthesis [@MethotWetzel2013] version `r ss_version` was the modeling platform
used. The largest changes between the `r last_assess_yr` and `r assess_yr`
stock assessments are the addition of another year of fishery data, a change
in the estimation of recruitment from 2023 onwards, and the exclusion of the
age-1 index of relative numbers of age-1 fish from the acoustic survey.
Given the unique
seasonal fishing conditions during the year, the fishery age composition of age-1 fish
in 2024 was considered
potentially suspect as a standalone observation (i.e., without the addition of survey information).
Therefore, recruitment in 2023 was based on the stock--recruitment relationship
(no additional recruitment deviate estimate). In addition, no recruitment deviations were
estimated for `r end_yr - 1` onwards (including the forecast years) because no information is available
to inform the estimates. The age-1 index
(Section~\@ref(sec:data-acoustic-survey)) was excluded from the base model
because it was found to be strongly influencing recruitment estimates even for
cohorts that had several years of data (see
Section~\@ref(sec:assessment-changes)), and it does not have an externally
calculated measure of uncertainty.

The `r assess_yr` base model includes a time series (1995 to
`r last_survey_yr`) of acoustic age-2$+$ biomass estimates. Maturity is assumed to be time-invariant prior to 2009,
and time-varying, with the integration of annual maturity ogives informed by sea
temperature at depth, since 2009 (see Section~\@ref(sec:data-maturity)).
Fecundity-at-age is time-varying as defined by annual weight-at-age
multiplied by annual maturity ogives (`r start_yr_age_comps`--`r last_data_yr`;
additionally see Section~\@ref(sec:data-weight-at-age)). The D-M likelihood approach
[@ThorsonEtAl2017Dirichlet] is used to estimate the weights associated
with age-composition data, rather than iteratively tuning the sample size
multiplier as in 2017 and earlier assessments (see
Section~\@ref(sec:data-age-comp-likelihood)). Time-varying fishery
selectivity is retained in the `r assess_yr` base model with the magnitude
of the allowable deviations unchanged from the `r last_assess_yr` base model
(see Section~\@ref(sec:data-variability-selectivity)). The general
parameterization of selectivity was retained, although additional parameters
were required to estimate an additional year of deviations. The selectivity
of the acoustic survey is assumed to be time invariant. Selectivity curves
were modeled as non-parametric functions estimating age-specific values for
each age beginning at age two for the index of age-2$+$ biomass and age one for
the fishery until a maximum age of 6, after which all ages are assumed to have
the same selectivity.

Prior probability distributions are used for a select few parameters and fixed
values are used for several parameters. For the base model, the instantaneous
rate of time-invariant natural mortality ($M$) is estimated with a `r m_prior[1]` prior
having a median of `r f(exp(as.numeric(m_prior[2])), 2)` and a standard
deviation (in log-space) of 0.1 (see
Section~\@ref(sec:data-natural-mortality)). The stock--recruitment relationship is
a Beverton--Holt parameterization, with the log of the mean unexploited
recruitment (log `r r_0`) freely estimated. This assessment uses the same
beta-distributed prior for stock--recruitment steepness ($h$), based on
@MyersBowenEtAl1999, that has been applied since 2011
[@StewartForrestEtAl2011]. Year-specific recruitment deviations were estimated
from `r main_recdev_early`--`r main_recdev_end`. The standard
deviation, $\sigma_r$, of recruitment variability serves as a recruitment
deviation constraint and is fixed at `r base_model$sigma_R_in` in this
assessment. This value is based on consistency with the observed variability
in the time series of recruitment deviation estimates and is the same as
assumed in assessments from 2013 to `r last_assess_yr`
(Table~\@ref(tab:main-assessment-changes-tab)). Catchabilities associated with the
biomass index (*q*~b~), and with the relative age-1 index (*q*~1~) bridging
model, were calculated
analytically as per @LudwigWalters1981 for each sample of posterior parameters,
resulting in a distribution of catchability for each.

Statistical likelihood functions used for data fitting are typical of many
stock assessments. The biomass index was fit via a lognormal likelihood
function, using the observed (and extra 2009) sampling variability, estimated
via kriging, as year-specific weightings. When included, the relative age-1 index was
specified as having a Student's t-distribution for its error structure with the
number of degrees of freedom equal to one less than the number of available
data points, and its selectivity was set to one for age one and zero for all other ages.
An additional constant and additive standard deviation on the
log-scale component is included for the biomass index (and the relative
age-1 index when included), which was freely estimated to accommodate unaccounted-for sources
of process and observation error. A D-M likelihood was applied to
age-composition data, with input sample sizes equal to the sum of the number of
trips and hauls sampled across all fishing fleets or the number of trawl sets
in the research surveys (see Section~\@ref(sec:data-age-comp-likelihood)).

Model results and statistical inference were based on
`r f(num_mcmc_samples)` MCMC samples (using the \texttt{adnuts} R package;
@Monnahan2018) compiled across 8 chains, each with a 250 sample burn in
period, to describe posterior distributions for model
parameters and derived quantities. The number of samples used for bridging
models, sensitivity models, and retrospective models was also
`r f(num_mcmc_samples)`. Medians (50% quantiles) are reported together with
the bounds of 95% credibility intervals calculated as the 2.5% quantile and
the 97.5% quantile of posterior distributions from the MCMC samples, to
give equal-tailed intervals. A full explanation of the NUTS algorithm and the
\texttt{adnuts} package, including an analysis with the `r sp` stock can be found
in @Monnahan2019.

## Response to `r end_yr - 1` Scientific Review Group (SRG) review {#sec:assessment-response-review}

The Scientific Review Group (SRG) meeting was held from February
6--9th, 2024, at the Vancouver Island Conference Centre, Nanaimo, BC.

The following are the 'SRG Recommendations and Conclusions for the Stock
Assessment' from the 2024 SRG report and the associated responses from the
JTC:

1. **The SRG recommends continuing sensitivities for steepness, natural mortality
, $\sigma_R$, excluding the age-1 index, alternative standard deviations for
time-varying selectivity, and down-weighting fishery age-composition data.**

*Response -- The incorporation of these sensitivities have been included per our
standard workflow. Due to the removal of the age-1 index in the base model this year,
the relevant sensitivity model was to include the age-1 index.*

2. **The SRG recommends that the JTC explore alternative ways of estimating
natural mortality ($M$) to update the current approach in the model, which
is based on methods from more than a decade ago, and particularly consider
options which have age-based $M$.**

*Response -- `r sp` have several natural predators, including themselves,
particularly on younger ages. Recently, [Trzcinski et al. (2024)](https://scholar.
google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps_oa/m743p113.
pdf&hl=en&sa=X&d=7035063540343333520&ei=dg3KZvPXCq-Ly9YPsfnLwQs&scisig=
AFWwaeZ0XVe4uuKTGL-PCWaZhm-R&oi=scholaralrt&hist=_VMmiPwAAAAJ:9480142533121162666:
AFWwaea2_PScUeInVLp6dXD_hYL6&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top) identified `r sp` as the largest
mean proportion of the diet of harbor seals. Additionally, the abundance of harbor
seals is near carrying capacity in Canadian waters and has been since the late 1990s.
Stock Synthesis allows for the inclusion of a predator index to estimate predation
mortality in addition to baseline natural mortality. Data for predation mortality can be
absolute numbers of dead fish due to the predator, an index of predator effort, and
predation composition (age or length) data. A predation index based on estimated
abundance of harbor seals could be added to the assessment model, but this has not
been explored.*

*A potential, better path forward is to use Dynamic Structural Equation
Modeling (DSEM) to include indices for multiple predators and allow for two-way
interactions between them and $M$. This capability is not, and will not be,
available within Stock Synthesis but is possible using models written in
Template Model Builder. A proof of concept has been implemented at the Alaska
Fisheries Science Center and discussions are ongoing to implement this in the
Fisheries Integrated Modeling System (FIMS). Thus, for the 2025 assessment a
simple version of FIMS will be fit, where the simple version does not have the
capacity to estimate ageing error or facilitate DSEMs. A more complex FIMS
model will be presented to the SRG in 2026.*

*In 2023 the JTC unsuccessfully estimated age-specific $M$ using Stock
Synthesis, where it was seen as an unsuccessful exercise because estimates of
$M$ increased with age due to a lack of data to inform the estimates.
Second, the JTC explored the use of Lorenzen $M$ but this is not possible in
Stock Synthesis without simultaneously estimating growth. Thus, the JTC sees
using estimates of age-specific $M$ from the Climate- Enhanced, Age-based model
with Temperature-specific Trophic Linkages and Energetics (CEATTLE) model as a
way forward [@HolsmanEtAl2016]. Output from CEATTLE includes time series of
estimates of baseline $M$ and estimates of $M$ at age for ages 0--1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
and 6$^+$, where the $M$ at-age estimates are strictly natural mortality due to
cannibalism. Two sensitivities were run for this assessment, one where
baseline mortality at age was fixed and one where it was estimated. Results
are presented in Section~\@ref(sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses).*

3. **The SRG encourages an analysis of catch and biomass distribution for Canada and
US that examines latitudinal shifts in fishing over time, and tries to predict factors
influencing these shifts.**

*Response -- The JTC is collaborating with lead analyst Owen Liu (NWFSC) who is building
species distribution models for Pacific Hake. This work will include incorporating environmental
factors across the full transboundary range of Pacific Hake and will evaluate prediction skill
for developing short-term forecasts. Results from this work are expected to be presented
at the 2026 SRG meeting.*

*The JTC is also investigating patterns of hake in the U.S. West Coast Bottom Trawl Survey
in California waters where fishery data is limited. Data sharing agreements between
countries are concurrently being developed so that the JTC can explore coast-wide fishing location
information to better understand spatial fleet dynamics over time. The JTC will also be
investigating spatial fishing effort, catch, and revenue over time using data summary
tools (e.g., Pacific Fishing Effort Mapping Project) that are currently under development (but available for beta
explorations).*

4. **Pacific Hake dynamics are highly variable even without fishing mortality. The
SRG applauds the efforts of the JTC to estimate dynamic reference points, and encourages
efforts by the MSE Technical Team to include dynamic reference points in the MSE process.**

*Response -- There has been limited time (thus far) to evaluate dynamic reference points
using the MSE. The MSE technical team lost the dedicated MSE post-doc earlier this year,
and the previous MSE coordinator at the NWFSC, Kristin Marshall, has moved to a new
position. The JTC is attempting to balance their available research time in 2025 with
requests such as this one with others (e.g., request 11). The JTC has included dynamic
reference point figures and summary metrics in this stock assessment.*

5. **The SRG recommends continued work to collect ovary samples, with a focus on
fecundity and functional maturity, as well as continued annual maturity analysis.**

*Response -- The estimates of maturity have been updated with recent data for
this assessment. The selection of the best day of the year to predict maturity to remains
an area for further discussion. The JTC has researched the internal assumptions of
Stock Synthesis to help inform the best day of the year, but no investigation can make
up for the lack of data during the winter spawning season. Additional work is being put
forward to implement a research effort with Oregon State University and the University
of Washington to investigate broader assumptions about `r sp` fecundity.*

6. **On three occasions since 2009 (2011--12, 2016--17, 2023), stock assessments have
predicted a rapid increase in biomass similar to that seen in the 2024 assessment, where
this rapid increase was not visible in subsequent assessments. The SRG recommends
investigating what factors might be causing these shifts in biomass estimates and
projections.**

*Response -- This comment seems to arise from Figure 63
showing summaries of historical assessment estimates of spawning biomass. Uncertainty is not fully
considered in this figure because it is only shown for the most recent assessment (i.e., only point
estimates are shown for historical estimates). In particular, with median estimates presented:*

- *from 2010--11 (presumably, not 2011--12) the subsequent assessments greatly reduce
the absolute size of the stock, but still show an increase, likely due to the change in
data included in 2012 (e.g., addition of 2011 survey biomass estimate).*

- *from 2016--17 and 2023 the increases are actually larger in later
assessments, not smaller. For example, 2016--17 increase from each assessment is:*
  - *2017 base model: increase of 136,000 t*
  - *2018 base model: increase of 194,000 t*
  - *2024 base model: increase of 423,000 t;*

- *the 2022--2023 (presumably) increase from each assessment is:*
  - *2023 base model: increase of 486,000 t*
  - *2024 base model: increase of 549,000 t*.

 *An age-0 recruitment index could help, and the JTC plans to continue analyses
 of age-0 Pacific Hake data presented at previous SRG meetings when time allows.*

7. **The SRG encourages the JTC to consider methods to determine the maximum input
sample size for the age compositions (e.g., Stewart and Hamel 2014, Hulson et al. 2023).**

*Response -- The JTC agrees that determining input sample sizes is important for fishery
and survey age compositions, which then provides the basis from which model-based re-weighting
is done. The JTC has considered alternative methods and has determined additional research
is needed to inform the calculation of input sample size for both fishery and survey ages.
Fishery input sample sizes are calculated using a mixture of either the number of hauls or trips,
when haul information is not available (e.g., shoreside), and further work is needed to
determine the effective sample sizes at the haul and trip level and how to calculate a fleet-wide
input sample size. Survey age compositions represent age structure associated with the acoustic
survey as viewed through an estimated selectivity curve for the acoustic-trawl sampling net.
Yet, selectivity for ages two and older with acoustics is theoretically at or near one.
Additionally, if the survey moves to using a new net, changing selectivity, the effective sample
size could vary requiring consideration on how to model the survey. The JTC did not
investigate this issue for this year's assessment but supports the prioritization of this
research for future assessments.*

*Instead, the JTC has conducted a sensitivity analyses using input sample sizes following the
Stewart and Hamel (2014) approach. The results of that sensitivity are included in
Section~\@ref(sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses).*

8. **The SRG has previously noted that $\sigma_R$ is an influential parameter,
and encourages further work by the JTC. The SRG supports continuing efforts to
explore new recruitment parameterizations, including treating recruitment deviations
as random effects, to better estimate $\sigma_R$.**

*Response -- Future improvements in the stock assessment software used to assess Pacific Hake
(e.g., ability to use random effects in the modeling framework) will allow for fruitful
work on this.  The Fisheries Integrated Modeling System (FIMS) will replace Stock
Synthesis in the coming years and will have random effects capabilities. The Pacific
Hake assessment is a primary test case for FIMS, and further versions of the `r sp`
assessment in FIMS are expected at forthcoming SRG meetings.*

*Other frameworks (e.g., Woods Hole Assessment Model, or WHAM, and bespoke models) can
already use random effects.  The JTC has completed initial explorations using WHAM
and concluded random effect structures will be beneficial for modeling Pacific Hake.*

*The JTC is also following pertinent research aimed at advancing related novel methods
(e.g., dynamic structural equation models) for incorporating time-variation into
stock assessment models (occurring at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center and University of Washington) and
approaches for operational assessment use, including the estimation of $\sigma_R$.*

9. **The SRG noted that the age-1 index did not include a value for 2001 because
it was zero. Although this decision had negligible influence on the results because
the estimate for 2000 recruitment was close to zero, the SRG noted that Stock Synthesis
uses a lognormal likelihood which does not handle zero values. Given that future zero
values are expected to have a bigger influence on the results in the short-term, the
SRG recommends that the JTC explore likelihood forms that can fit to very low index
values from the age-1 survey (e.g., robust likelihood). The SRG acknowledges that
implementing new likelihoods will require changes to the Stock Synthesis platform.**

*Response -- Researchers at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center have the same problem
and have yet to find a solution. The JTC will not be investigating this in the near
future nor will Stock Synthesis be altered to accommodate a future solution. However,
the JTC will continue to monitor new research on this front as new assessment
platforms are developed.*

10. **The SRG recommends that the JMC review the decision tables and reconsider
required harvest scenarios to reduce the number of similar and overlapping
Scenarios.**

*Response -- The JTC helped initiate discussions on decision table structure at
a 6 December 2024 JMC meeting. Refinements of the number of catch scenarios were discussed
and a JMC recommendation was put forth. The JTC followed those recommendations for the
decision tables used in this assessment. This included a reduction in the total number
of catch scenarios.*

11. **The SRG noted that alternative structures of the assessment model have not been
comprehensively examined since 2011 (e.g., multiple fleets and/or spatial model), and
were informed that limited staffing and availability of the JTC inhibits these
time-consuming analyses. The SRG recommends examining structural assumptions of the
stock assessment as time allows. More complex structural assumptions may utilize the
data more thoroughly, explain different trends across areas and/or fleets, and estimate
stock status more accurately, but simpler models may be more appropriate for determination
of the TAC. The MSE can be used to determine best performing assessment models for
management.**

*Response -- The JTC plans to evaluate the multitude of changes in the assessment process
itself (e.g., data availability, assumptions, etc.) that would be needed to develop
alternative model structures and share future plans at the 2025 SRG meeting. This includes
the development of a research plan, including complimentary or standalone analyses, alternative
model structures to explore, and simulation analyses to evaluate and compare alternative
models (e.g., using one or more tools, such as MSE).*

*The JTC explored the ability to disaggregate data across the entire historical time series.
There are no issues with catch data, because those data are already disaggregated by fleet
across the time series. Similarly, biological data are already disaggregated from 2007 to
present. However, the ability to disaggregate pre-2007 biological is not immediately straightforward
given new data pulls for these historical data are not typically conducted. Differences resulting from
new data pulls need to be thoroughly investigated.*

*Other steps the JTC plans to take in the future include evaluating alternative data and model
assumptions that arise for validity given proposed new model structures; evaluating variance
and bias trade-offs associated with new parameterizations (e.g., doubling the number of
time-varying selectivity parameters when doubling the number of fleets); comparing
alternative spatially-implicit assessment approaches (e.g., time-varying selectivity
versus area-varying selectivity, or both); and developing states of nature scenarios
to test model structure robustness in an MSE framework.*

*Additionally, model complexity in the spatial domain needs to be addressed relative to
other structural assumptions in the assessment model.  Other assumptions may have a higher
propensity to be influential and be more sensitive to model results. These may include data
weighting, improving estimates of natural mortality via predator time series, multiple fleets
instead of a single aggregated fleet, and using fleet-specific weight-at-age data instead of
aggregated weight-at-age (the JTC has looked at this before, but it hasn't been revisited in
over a decade).*

*Changes to the structure of the assessment model may not be the most immediate need for
understanding changes in hake distribution. Some of the other (higher priority) SRG requests noted
above will help with understanding fundamental mechanisms, which can help to formulate hypotheses
to inform relevant model structures. These include spatial CPUE modeling, investigating hake
distribution changes in bottom trawl surveys, correlating hake distribution changes with California
Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment results, and `r sp` distribution modeling research informed by environmental data.*

## Modeling results {#sec:assessment-modeling-results}

### Changes from `r last_assess_yr` {#sec:assessment-changes}

A set of `bridging' models was constructed to evaluate the component-specific
effects of the steps to change from the `r last_assess_yr` base model to
the `r assess_yr` base model. The steps are as follows:

- Update to the latest version of Stock Synthesis, version `r ss_version`, to
follow current best practices;
- Incrementally update catch, maturity-at-age/weight-at-age/fecundity-at-age, and fishery age-composition data from years previous to `r last_data_yr` (in that order);
- Incrementally add `r last_data_yr` catch, maturity-at-age/weight-at-age/fecundity-at-age, and fishery age-composition data (in that order);
- Turn off estimation of the `r last_data_yr - 1` and `r last_data_yr`
  recruitment deviations (i.e., recruitment comes from the stock--recruitment
  relationship) due to limited data to inform the estimation of
  `r last_data_yr - 1` year class strength in the absence of survey
  data. Similarly, no recruitment deviations were estimated during the forecast
  period; and
- Exclude the age-1 index.

Stock Synthesis version `r ss_version` includes a number of changes since the
version used by @JTC2024. However, none of the changes were specifically relevant
to this assessment, and thus, the software update had no effect on assessment
results (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-bridge-summary-1-fig)).

The update of pre-`r last_data_yr` data occurs because databases are
continually updated; this yielded minor adjustments to the data. For example,
samples that were recently aged but not available for the `r last_assess_yr`
assessment were included. Updates to pre-`r last_assess_yr` data were
small enough that they had little impact on the model results.

The addition of the `r last_data_yr` catch, modelled weight-at-age estimates,
and fishery age compositions extends the model to the start of `r assess_yr`.
Historical recruitment estimates and the stock trajectory were relatively
unchanged through 2023 (except for changes in recruitment due to adding fishery age
compositions), but female spawning biomass increased in the final
year of the model due to the estimate of above-average recruitment in
`r last_data_yr-1` (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-bridge-summary-2-fig)).
With the lack of a survey in 2024, the `r last_data_yr-1` recruitment deviation
is being informed solely by age-1 observations in the `r last_data_yr` fishery
age-composition data.

<!---
Including the `r last_data_yr` fishery-independent biomass estimate led to a downward shift
in the stock trajectory going back to 2017 and a similar shift in the fit to the survey
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-bridge-summary-1-fig)). The addition of the `r last_data_yr` survey
biomass age compositions led to an estimated increase in stock biomass from 2023 to 2024 as a result of small shifts in expected recruitment, particularly for the 2020 and 2021 year
classes. While the addition of the `r last_data_yr` relative age-1 index
had a negligible effect on the stock trajectory, it did slightly adjust estimates of recent
recruitment strength, in particular raising the 2022 recruitment somewhat.
--->

The penultimate step in this year's bridging led to turning off the estimation of the
`r last_data_yr - 1` and `r last_data_yr` recruitment deviations (i.e.,
recruitment without deviation from the stock--recruitment relationship,
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-bridge-summary-2-fig)). Given the unique seasonal fishing
conditions during the year, the 2023 estimate of recruitment was considered
potentially suspect without the addition of survey information. This change led
to decreased estimates of female spawning biomass at the start of `r assess_yr`
relative to the previous model bridging steps. The next assessment will include
data from the `r assess_yr` survey that will provide an age-2+ index with age
compositions providing additional information on the `r last_data_yr-1`
year-class strength. Given this survey information, the `r assess_yr+1` assessment will explore
estimating recruitment deviations for `r last_data_yr-1` and beyond.

The final bridging step was to exclude the age-1 index from the base model. Exluding
the age-1 index considerably shifted the female spawning biomass trajectory
downwards from 2015 onwards, with the largest changes coming since 2022
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-bridge-summary-2-fig)). Recruitment deviations in 2018 and 2022 were
reduced considerably, while all others since 2019 were slightly reduced. The fit to the
acoustic survey index in 2023 was improved, but the fit in 2021 was lessened.

The decision to exclude the age-1 index occurred through discussions and
supporting analyses at the `r assess_yr` Scientific
Review Group meeting (see Appendix~\@ref(sec:app-srg-requests) for additional details).
In summary, the performance of the age-1 index over recent years was called into question
given that it was found to be strongly influencing recruitment estimates even for
cohorts that had several years of data (going back to 2015). In addition, the age-1
index does not have an externally calculated measure of uncertainty, including any
measure of year to year differences in the quality of the index. Analyses
conducted during the review week identified the 2019 and 2023 index points as having
a particularly high impact on model results. The model considerably underfit these
data points such that the age-1 index was suggesting larger recruitment in 2018 and 2022
than all other data sources in the assessment. Further analyses into the performance of the
age-1 index and the quantification of yearly uncertainty measures will provide the means to
potentially include this index once again in future assessments.

### Assessment model results {#sec:assessment-model-results}

**Model Fit**

Stationarity of the posterior distribution for model parameters was assessed
via a suite of standard single-chain and multi-chain diagnostic tests
via graphical summaries and interactive web applications
([ShinySTAN](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/shinystan);
Appendix~\@ref(sec:app-mcmc-diagnostics)).
All estimated parameters showed good mixing during sampling,
no evidence for lack of convergence, and acceptable autocorrelation (results
for some key parameters are shown in
Figures~\@ref(fig:app-mcmc-diag-m-r0-fig)--\@ref(fig:app-mcmc-diag-dm-fig)).
Correlation-corrected effective sample sizes were sufficient to summarize the
posterior distributions and neither the Geweke nor the Heidelberger and Welch
statistics for these parameters exceeded critical values more frequently than
expected via random chance (Figure~\@ref(fig:app-mcmc-diag-hists-fig)). The
Gelman-Rubin multi-chain diagnostic test, which compares within-chain variance
to among-chain variance, further indicated that convergence was adequately
achieved (examined via \texttt{ShinySTAN}). Correlations among key parameters were
generally low, with the exception of $M$ and $\log R_0$
(Figure~\@ref(fig:app-mcmc-pairs-fig)). Estimates of recruitment in 2014 and
2016 were correlated with the derived quantity of catch from the default
harvest rule in `r end_yr`, as to be expected given the dependencies among
these quantities (Figure~\@ref(fig:app-mcmc-pairs-fig)). An examination of
deviations in recruitment (log-scale differences between estimated and
expected recruitment values) from recent years
(Figures~\@ref(fig:app-mcmc-pairs-fig) and \@ref(fig:app-mcmc-pairs-recruit-devs-fig))
indicates the highest correlation (`r f(base_model$mcmcvals$rec_cor_2014_2016, 2)`)
was between the 2014 and 2016 recruitment deviations. This is the same as in
the last assessment despite the fact that each cohort
has been observed for an additional year.

Regarding the D-M parameter $\theta_{\text{fish}}$,
the estimate (median and 95% credible interval) for
$\log \theta_{\text{fish}}$ was
`r f(log_theta_fishery_median, 3)`
(`r f(log_theta_fishery_lower, 3)` to `r f(log_theta_fishery_upper, 3)`),
giving an effective sample size multiplier
$\theta_{\text{fish}} / (1 + \theta_{\text{fish}})$ of
`r f(dm_weight_fishery_median, 3)`
(`r f(dm_weight_fishery_lower, 3)`--`r f(dm_weight_fishery_upper, 3)`).
The related log of the survey age-composition parameter $\theta_{\text{surv}}$,
i.e., $\log \theta_{\text{surv}}$, was
`r f(log_theta_survey_median, 3)`
(`r f(log_theta_survey_lower, 3)`--`r f(log_theta_survey_upper, 3)`),
and the resulting effective sample size
multiplier $\theta_{\text{surv}} / (1 + \theta_{\text{surv}})$ of
`r f(dm_weight_survey_median, 3)`
(`r f(dm_weight_survey_lower, 3)`--`r f(dm_weight_survey_upper, 3)`).

The base model fit to the acoustic survey biomass index
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-survey-index-fit-mcmc-fig)) remains similar to the
`r last_assess_yr` base model, except the fit to the 2023 survey biomass is
slightly improved. The low `r last_survey_yr` survey
biomass pulls down the last few years of estimated biomass, such that the fit
to the 2019 data point is very good compared to the 2023 assessment when it
was overestimated. The 2021 fit remains underestimated but within the range
of the input standard deviation.
The median of the posterior distribution for the analytically-derived
catchability associated with the acoustic survey biomass index ($q_b$)
was `r f(median(base_model$extra_mcmc$q_vector), 3)`
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-catchability-density-fig)).

The 2023 biomass index is the third lowest in the series
(Table~\@ref(tab:main-survey-history-tab)), and is below the model
estimate, similar to the 2001 index that has always been below
model estimates [@JTC2023]. While no direct cause for the
2001 index anomaly is known, the survey did begin earlier that year than all other surveys
between 1995 and 2009 (Table~\@ref(tab:main-survey-history-tab)), which may
explain some portion of the anomaly, along with age
structure. For 2023, the survey timing is not anomalous. The estimated biomass
increase from 2023 to 2024 is driven by the addition of 2023 survey age-composition data
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-bridge-summary-1-fig)).

The relatively stable estimated biomass from
2013--2019 is unchanged from the previous assessment.
The underestimation of the 2009 and 2023 biomass estimates are larger than
the underestimation of any other year. The uncertainty of the 2009 value (both
modeled and actual) is high because of the presence of large numbers of
Humboldt Squid during the survey. Humboldt Squid have similar target
strength to hake which could introduce bias in the biomass estimate for that
year, which also likely influenced the population dynamics of `r sp` through
predation in that year. Future data will reduce the large uncertainty in the
2023 biomass estimate, which may reduce the underestimation.

Differences between the median posterior density estimates from the fit to the
survey index are likely due to slight differences in what the fishery composition data
and survey composition data, when considered independently, would otherwise
suggest as population trends. Additionally, the population has undergone
recent high, but declining, catch levels and produced a couple of
above-average cohorts that are now mature.

<!--`r f(median(base_model$extra_mcmc$q_vector_age1), 3)` -->
<!--(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-catchability-density-age1-fig)). -->

Fits to the age-composition data continue to show close correspondence to the
dominant and small cohorts observed in the data when the data give a
consistent signal (Figures~\@ref(fig:main-age-comp-fits-fishery-fig) and
\@ref(fig:main-age-comp-fits-survey-fig)). The fit to commercial age-composition
data is particularly good as a result of the large sample sizes and time-varying
selectivity parameterization. In the `r last_data_yr`
fishery, `r top_coh(base_model, last_data_yr, 3, cap = FALSE)`. Age
compositions from the `r survey_end_yr` acoustic survey suggest a similar age
structure for older fish.

The 2020 cohort is well fit by the acoustic survey
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-age-comp-fits-survey-fig)).
Combined, the 2015--`r last_data_yr` fishery age-composition
data and the 2017--`r survey_end_yr` acoustic survey age-composition data
suggest that 2014 was a strong recruitment year, and the model was able to
adequately fit these observations
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-age-comp-fits-survey-fig)).
The 2016 cohort, which has been observed three times by the survey,
still appears to be smaller than the 2014 cohort.

The `r survey_end_yr` survey was the first
to sample the `r survey_end_yr - 2` cohort, suggesting that it was a large
contingent of the population (`r survey_a2_prop`% of the `r survey_end_yr` survey catch). The 2020 cohort,
which has now been observed by the acoustic survey, is expected to be above average in size.
Residual patterns to the fishery and survey age data do not show patterns
that would indicate systematic bias in model predictions
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-age-comp-pearson-fig)).

The median estimates for numbers, biomass, exploitation rate, and catch (in
numbers and in biomass) for each age class in each year are given in
Tables~\@ref(tab:main-est-numbers-at-age-tab)--
\@ref(tab:main-est-catch-at-age-biomass-tab).
For the major cohorts, the resulting estimated age-specific catch, natural
mortality, and surviving biomasses are given in
Table~\@ref(tab:main-cohort-effects-tab). For example, at age-4 the catch weight of the
2016 cohort was slightly more than that of the 2014 cohort,
and the resulting surviving biomass of the 2016 cohort was approximately one-third
of the surviving biomass of the 2014 cohort.

Posterior distributions for both steepness and natural mortality are
influenced by priors (Figures~\@ref(fig:main-prior-posterior-fig)--
\@ref(fig:main-prior-posterior-truncated-fig)). The posterior for steepness is
only slightly updated by the data, as expected given the low level of
information available to inform steepness as found in previous hake
assessments. The posterior of natural mortality, on the other hand, is shifted
to the right of the prior distribution and the prior may be constraining the
posterior distribution from shifting further. Broadening the prior
distribution by increasing the prior standard deviation for the natural
mortality parameter is examined in sensitivity runs (see
Section~\@ref(sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses)). Other parameters showed
updating from diffuse priors to posterior distributions, including
$\log \theta_{\text{fish}}$ and  $\log \theta_{\text{surv}}$ (as outlined in
Section~\@ref(sec:data-age-comp-likelihood)).

The `r assess_yr` base model specified the same level of variation (standard
deviation of $\Phi =$ `r sel_phi_val`) associated with time-varying fishery
selectivity as the `r last_assess_yr` base model, effectively allowing the
model flexibility (i.e., a lower penalty on the overall likelihood) to fit to
data that suggests high variability among years for each age. This level of
variation led to results that remained consistent with the `r survey_end_yr`
acoustic survey age-composition data (but not the biomass index) and gave reasonable fits to the fishery
age-composition data, given that there is considerable uncertainty associated
with spatial changes in fish availability (due to movement) and recent
variability in oceanographic conditions. Estimated selectivity deviations for
age-3 and age-4 fish are larger from 2010 to 2012 than in subsequent years
until 2020 when the deviation for age-4 was large again
(Figures~\@ref(fig:main-tv-selex-fig) and
\@ref(fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty-fig)). The median selectivity peaks at
age-4 in 2010, 2012 and 2020 and at age-3 in 2011 suggesting targeting (or
generally higher availability) of the younger cohorts in those years. This
pattern is consistent with the 2008 cohort appearing strong in the fishery
age compositions initially, but decreasing in prominence from 2013 onward (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-age-comp-fits-fishery-fig)). Fishery selectivity on
age-2 fish was at its highest in 2016. Fishery selectivity for
`r last_data_yr` was higher than average for age-1 fish
followed by a relatively flat pattern from age-2 to age-5 before increasing
at older ages (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty-fig)).
Even though the survey selectivity is time invariant, the posterior shows a
broad
band of uncertainty between ages 2 and 5
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-tv-selex-posteriors-fig)). The decline in survey
selectivity between ages 3 and 4 may be an artifact of the interaction between
large cohorts and the biennial timing of recent surveys, with the 2010, 2014,
2016, and 2020 cohorts occurring in the survey at ages 3 and/or 5 but not age 4.
Fishery selectivity is likewise very uncertain
(Figures~\@ref(fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty-fig) and
\@ref(fig:main-tv-selex-posteriors-fig)), but in spite of this uncertainty,
changes in year-to-year patterns in the estimates are still evident,
particularly for age-2, age-3, and age-4 fish, though these patterns might
also reflect time-varying mortality processes.

**Stock biomass**

The base stock assessment model indicates that, since the 1960s, `r sp` female
spawning biomass has ranged from well below to above unfished equilibrium
(Figures~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-fig) and
\@ref(fig:main-relative-biomass-fig) and
Tables~\@ref(tab:main-median-posterior-tab) and
\@ref(tab:main-ci-posterior-tab)). The model estimates that it was below the
unfished equilibrium in the 1960s, at the start of the assessment period, due
to lower than average recruitment. The stock is estimated to have increased
rapidly and was above unfished equilibrium in the mid-1970s and mid-1980s
(after two large recruitments in the early 1980s). It then declined steadily
to a low in 1999. This was followed by a brief increase to a peak in 2003 as
the very large 1999 year class matured. The 1999 year class largely supported
the fishery for several years due to relatively small recruitments between
2000 and 2007. With the aging 1999 year class, median female spawning biomass
declined throughout the late 2000s, reaching a time-series low of
`r median_bio_min` million~t in `r median_bio_min_yr`. The assessment model
estimates that median female spawning biomass then peaked again in
2014 due to a very large 2010 year class and an above-average 2008 year
class. The subsequent decline from 2014 to 2016 is primarily from the 2010
year class surpassing the age at which gains in weight from growth are greater
than the loss in weight from mortality (growth-mortality transition). The
2014 year class is estimated to be large, though not as large as the 1999
and 2010 year classes, resulting in increasing biomass through 2018. The
estimated biomass declined
from 2018 to 2021 due to the 2014 and 2016 year classes moving through the
growth-mortality transition during a period of high catches. The increase in
female spawning biomass from 2022 through 2025 is due to the above-average 2020 and
2021 cohorts entering maturity and the recent declining trend in catch.

The median estimate of the `r end_yr` relative spawning biomass (spawning
biomass at the start of `r end_yr` divided by that at unfished equilibrium,
`r b_0`) is `r curr_depl_median`%. However, the uncertainty is large, with a
95% posterior credibility interval from `r curr_depl_lower`% to
`r curr_depl_upper`% (Tables~\@ref(tab:main-median-posterior-tab) and
\@ref(tab:main-ci-posterior-tab)), partly due to remaining unknowns about the size of the
potentially large 2021 cohort because the acoustic survey has only provided one year of
information about it during the 2023 survey. Even when used, the biennial age-1 index does not provide
additional information for odd year cohorts like this one.
<!-- for non-survey years: age-1 information, which is more uncertain than the -->
<!-- 2+ estimate. -->

The median estimate of the `r end_yr` female spawning biomass is
`r curr_bio_median` million~t (with a 95% posterior credibility interval from
`r curr_bio_lower` to `r curr_bio_upper` million~t). The current estimate of
the `r end_yr - 1` female spawning biomass is `r prev_bio_median`
(`r prev_bio_lower`--`r prev_bio_upper`) million~t, giving a narrower range of
uncertainty compared to the estimate from the `r end_yr - 1` assessment of `r prev_bio_median_last_assess`
(`r prev_bio_lower_last_assess`--`r prev_bio_upper_last_assess`) million~t. The current
median is reduced from last year, partly due to the influence of the age-2$+$ biomass index
pulling down the estimated biomass for recent years, the reduction in the estimate of
the 2022 year class with updated data, the removal of the age-1 index, and the setting of the 2023 year class using only
the stock-recruitment relationship (i.e., no estimated recruitment deviate; Figure~\@ref(fig:main-bridge-summary-1-fig)).

**Recruitment**

The new data for this assessment do not significantly change the general pattern of
recruitment estimated in recent assessments. However, estimates of absolute
recruitment for the most recent years can change with new data and updated
assumptions about recent recruitments.  In particular, the `r last_data_yr - 1` and `r last_data_yr` year classes were set based solely on the stock--recruitment relationship for this assessment, such that
no recruitment deviations were estimated for these years (as well as none for forecast years).
The only information on the size of the 2023 cohort
(age-1 fish in `r last_data_yr`) in this assessment comes from the age composition of fishery catches.
The catch of age-1 fish was particularly high in `r last_data_yr`, potentially due to the unique
seasonal fishing conditions during the year (see Appendix~\@ref(sec:app-us-fishery-report)) and the relative
loss of older age classes in the population. Thus, this data point was considered
suspect as a standalone observation (i.e., without the addition of survey information).
By restricting `r last_data_yr - 1` recruitment to the stock--recruitment relationship, the assessment model
was not allowed to predict a very high `r last_data_yr - 1` year class based solely on the age-1
catch in the fishery. Another year of data, particularly for the age-2$+$ acoustic--trawl
survey in `r assess_yr` will provide additional information on the size of the `r last_data_yr - 1` year class.

The 2021 recruitment is estimated to be well above average
(though highly uncertain), with the absolute size being similar to the
2014 year class (current estimate is `r recruitment_med_in_2021`, with
a 95% credible interval of `r f(base_model$mcmccalcs$rlower["2021"], 1)`--
`r f(base_model$mcmccalcs$rupper["2021"], 1)`~billion fish). Last year's assessment
also indicated a large 2021 year class, so the
addition of `r last_assess_yr` data did not appreciably change this estimate.
The 95% credible interval in the `r end_yr - 1` assessment was
`r f(last_yr_base_model$mcmccalcs$rlower["2021"], 2)`--
`r f(last_yr_base_model$mcmccalcs$rupper["2021"], 2)`~billion fish,
reduced and narrowed in the current assessment to
`r f(base_model$mcmccalcs$rlower["2021"], 1)`--
`r f(base_model$mcmccalcs$rupper["2021"], 1)`~billion fish.
The median has changed by
`r f(((((recruitment_med_to_compare - prev_assess_recruitment_med)["2021"]) /
(prev_assess_recruitment_med)["2021"]) * 100), 0)`%
(`r f(((recruitment_med_to_compare - prev_assess_recruitment_med)["2021"]), 1)`
~billion fish).
The general notion remains that recent
recruitment is highly uncertain, and estimates for recent years (based on
limited data) can change with more data.

The median estimate of 2020 recruitment continues to be estimated as above average,
though has declined slightly compared to the median estimate from last year's assessment
(`r f(base_model$mcmccalcs$rmed["2020"], 1)`~billion fish compared to
`r f(last_yr_base_model$mcmccalcs$rmed["2020"], 1)`~billion fish, respectively).
The addition of 2024 fishery data had little affect reducing the uncertainty associated
with the size of this cohort (95% interval:
`r f(base_model$mcmccalcs$rlower["2020"], 1)`--
`r f(base_model$mcmccalcs$rupper["2020"], 1)`~billion fish compared to last year's
model with `r f(last_yr_base_model$mcmccalcs$rlower["2020"], 1)`--
`r f(last_yr_base_model$mcmccalcs$rupper["2020"], 1)`~billion fish).

In general, `r sp` have low average recruitment (relative to the long-term average)
with occasional large year classes
(Figures~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-fig) and
\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-devs-fig),
Tables~\@ref(tab:main-median-posterior-tab) and
\@ref(tab:main-ci-posterior-tab)). Very large year classes in 1980, 1984,
and 1999 supported much of the commercial catch from the 1980s to the
mid-2000s. From 2000 to 2007, estimated recruitment was at some of the
lowest values in the time series, but this was followed by an above average
2008 year class and a very strong 2010 year class. Above average year classes
have occurred since then in 2014, 2016 and 2021, which have been sustaining the
fishery over the last decade (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-age-comp-fits-fishery-fig)).
The current assessment estimates a strong 2014 year class
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-numbers-at-age-fig)) comprising
`r top_coh(base_model, 2016, ret_cohort = 2014)`% of the 2016 catch,
`r top_coh(base_model, 2017, ret_cohort = 2014)`% of the 2017 catch,
`r top_coh(base_model, 2018, ret_cohort = 2014)`% of the 2018 catch,
`r top_coh(base_model, 2019, ret_cohort = 2014)`% of the 2019 catch,
`r top_coh(base_model, 2020, ret_cohort = 2014)`% of the 2020 catch,
`r top_coh(base_model, 2021, ret_cohort = 2014)`% of the 2021 catch,
`r top_coh(base_model, 2022, ret_cohort = 2014)`% of the 2022 catch,
`r top_coh(base_model, 2023, ret_cohort = 2014)`% of the 2023 catch, and
`r top_coh(base_model, 2024, ret_cohort = 2014)`% of the 2024 catch.
The strong 2016 cohort comprises
`r top_coh(base_model, 2018, ret_cohort = 2016)`% of the 2018 catch,
`r top_coh(base_model, 2019, ret_cohort = 2016)`% of the 2019 catch,
`r top_coh(base_model, 2020, ret_cohort = 2016)`% of the 2020 catch,
`r top_coh(base_model, 2021, ret_cohort = 2016)`% of the 2021 catch,
`r top_coh(base_model, 2022, ret_cohort = 2016)`% of the 2022 catch,
`r top_coh(base_model, 2023, ret_cohort = 2016)`% of the 2023 catch, and
`r top_coh(base_model, 2024, ret_cohort = 2016)`% of the 2024 catch.
The strong 2021 cohort comprises
`r top_coh(base_model, 2023, ret_cohort = 2021)`% of the 2023 catch, and
`r top_coh(base_model, 2024, ret_cohort = 2021)`% of the 2024 catch.

The large size of the 2014, 2016, and 2021 cohorts is informed by
observations from several years of fishery data and the acoustic survey.
For all other years from 2011 to 2022, the model currently estimates small year classes
<!-- see: yrs_since_2010_recruitment_med_below_mean -->
(median recruitment below the mean of all median
recruitments), except for 2020 as previously mentioned. The 2022 cohort was observed
in recent years by the fishery.  To date, this information
suggests that it is well below average (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-fig)).
It will be observed as part of the age-2$+$
survey index for the first time in 2025. There is no information in the data to estimate the
sizes of the `r end_yr-1` and `r end_yr` year classes. Retrospective analyses
of year class strength for young fish have shown the estimates of recent
recruitment to be unreliable prior to at least model age-3 (observed at age-2
the previous year)
without a survey in the most recent year and age-2 with a
survey.

From Figure~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-fig) it looks as though the 2014
recruitment could be as large as the 2010 recruitment. However, the assessment
model estimates a `r prob_percent_2014_rec_gt_2010_rec`% chance that this
could be the case. The overlapping of the credible intervals in
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-fig) is because large MCMC estimates of 2010
recruitment are associated with large estimates of 2014 recruitment
(presumably with large estimates of `r r_0`). By scaling all recruitments by
the 2010 recruitment, Figure~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-scale-all-fig) provides
an intuitive way to compare recruitment across years [see
@JTC2022 for motivation and methods]. It shows that
only the 1980 recruitment is probably larger than 2010 (median
relative value $>1$), and the 1984
recruitment has a small chance of being as large as 2010.
Whereas Figure~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-fig) suggests that 1967, 1973, 1977,
1999, 2014, and 2021 could also possibly be larger than in 2010, giving an
over-optimistic impression of how often we can expect cohorts the size of
the 2010 cohort to occur. The 2021 cohort is still very uncertain but has a
small chance of exceeding the 2010 cohort
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-scale-all-fig)).
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-scale-all-fig) shows how the 2010 cohort is the largest in
the last 30~years, and that such large cohorts are rarer than is inferred
from Figure~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-fig).

The estimated recruitments with uncertainty for each year and the overall
stock--recruitment relationship are provided in
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-stock-recruitment-fig). Extremely large variability
about the expectation and about the joint uncertainty of individual
recruitment and female spawning biomass pairs are evident. High and low
recruitments have been produced throughout the range of observed female
spawning biomass (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-stock-recruitment-fig)). The
standard deviation of the time series of median recruitment deviation
estimates for the years 1970--`r last_data_yr - 1`, which are informed by
the age compositions
<!--and the age-1 index,-->
is `r sd_med_recr_dev_estimates`.

**Exploitation status**

The median estimated relative fishing intensity on the stock is below
1.0 `r median_intensity_above_1_text` (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-fishing-intensity-fig) and
Tables~\@ref(tab:main-median-posterior-tab) and
\@ref(tab:main-ci-posterior-tab)). It was closest to 1.0 in 1999 and 2008,
but catch in 2008 did not exceed the catch limit that was specified,
based on the best available science and harvest control rules in place at the
time; however, catch did exceed the catch limit in 1999 (Table~\@ref(tab:main-landings-tac-tab)). Exploitation fraction (catch divided by biomass of fish of age-2 and
above) has shown relatively similar patterns
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-exploitation-fraction-fig) and
Tables~\@ref(tab:main-median-posterior-tab) and
\@ref(tab:main-ci-posterior-tab)). Although displaying similar patterns, the exploitation fraction does not necessarily correspond to fishing intensity
because fishing intensity more directly accounts for the age-structure of
both the population and the catch. Median relative fishing intensity is
estimated to have declined from `r median_intensity_2010`% in 2010 to
`r median_intensity_2015`% in 2015, and then leveled off around 80% from
2016 to 2019. It then declined to around 70% from 2020 to 2022 before declining further
to `r median_intensity_2024`% in 2024. The
median exploitation fraction has increased from a recent low of
`r exploitation_med_2012` in 2012 to `r exploitation_med_2021` in 2021. It has since declined
rapidly to `r exploitation_med_2024` in 2024.
Although there is a considerable amount of imprecision around these
recent estimates due to uncertainty in recruitment and spawning biomass,
the 95% posterior credibility interval of relative fishing intensity was
below 100% from 2013--2015 and again from 2020--2021 (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-fishing-intensity-fig)).

**Management performance**

Over the last decade (`r end_yr - 10`--`r end_yr - 1`), the mean coast-wide
utilization rate (i.e., proportion of catch target removed) has been
`r tot_last_10_yrs_attainment`% and catches have been below coast-wide
targets (Table~\@ref(tab:main-landings-tac-tab)). From `r end_yr - 5` to
`r end_yr - 1`, the mean utilization rates differed between the U.S.
(`r us_last_5_yrs_attainment`%) and Canada (`r can_last_5_yrs_attainment`%). While
Canada's rate was higher than the U.S.'s in 2020, it has dropped considerably
over the past few years to historic lows.
The utilization rate for the coast-wide fishery this year was the lowest of
the previous decade (`r tot_2024_attainment`%) due, in part, to difficulties
locating aggregations of fish during the Spring and throughout the year in northern
areas. Prior to 2024, the previous low was in 2015 at `r tot_2015_attainment`%
coast-wide attainment. Before 2015,
the under-utilization in the U.S. was mostly a result of unrealized
catch in the tribal apportionment, while reports from stakeholders in Canada
suggested that `r sp` were less aggregated in Canada and availability had
declined. In 2016, the utilization rate increased but remained below pre-2015
levels, despite the total 2016 catch being one of the highest of the preceding
years. This is in large part due to increasing catch targets as biomass
continues to increase. While the total utilization rate between 2017--2021 was
relatively steady,
<!-- and close to the average over the last decade (`r tot_last_10_yrs_attainment`%) -->
it decreased to
`r tot_penult_yr_attainment`% in `r last_data_yr - 1` and to
`r tot_last_yr_attainment`% in `r last_data_yr`. This is due to the utilization rate in
Canada steadily declining since 2020 to the time-series low in 2024, and
also a fall in the U.S. utilization rate to 40.7% in 2024.
Country-specific quotas (or catch targets) in 2020 and 2021 were specified
unilaterally, due to the lack of an agreement on coast-wide 2020 and 2021
TACs. The usual `r us_allotment_percent`% and `r can_allotment_percent`%
allocation of coast-wide TAC, as specified in the Joint U.S.-Canada
Agreement for `r sp`, was once again implemented since 2022.
Total landings last exceeded the coast-wide quota in 2002 when utilization
was 112%.

As noted above, the median relative fishing intensity was below 100% (i.e.
median fishing intensity below `r fspr_40`)
`r median_intensity_above_1_text`. The median relative spawning biomass
was above 40% (the `r b_40` reference point) in all years except 2007--2009 and 2011
(Table~\@ref(tab:main-median-posterior-tab) and
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-relative-biomass-fig)).
These are also shown on a phase plot of the joint history of relative
spawning biomass and relative fishing intensity
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-phase-fig)). Relative spawning biomass increased from
the lows in 2007--2011 with above average recruitment in 2008, 2010, 2014,
2016, and 2021. Correspondingly, median relative fishing intensity has
remained below 100%, and total catch has been declining since the
time series high in 2017. While there is large uncertainty in the `r end_yr-1`
estimates of relative fishing intensity and relative spawning biomass,
the model estimates a `r joint_percent_prob_above_below`% joint probability
of being both above the `r fspr_40` fishing intensity in `r end_yr - 1`
and below the `r b_40` spawning biomass level at the start of
`r end_yr`.

## Model uncertainty {#sec:assessment-model-uncertainty}

The base assessment model integrates over the substantial uncertainty
associated with several important model parameters including: biomass
index catchability (*q*~b) and
observation errors, the
magnitude of the stock (via the `r r_0` parameter for equilibrium recruitment),
productivity of the stock (via the steepness parameter, *h*, of the
stock--recruitment relationship), the rate of natural mortality (*M*), annual
selectivity for key ages, recruitment deviations, and survey and fishery data
weights (via the D-M parameters
$\theta_{\text{fish}}$ and $\theta_{\text{surv}}$).

The medians of the key parameters from the posterior distribution changed somewhat
compared to those in last year's base model
(Table~\@ref(tab:main-parameter-estimates-tab)). Parameter differences were largely due to
the removal of the age-1 index this year, but also from other data and structural
changes (see Section~\@ref(sec:assessment-changes)).
For derived management quantities, the largest change was a reduction in the
estimated relative spawning biomass at the start of 2024 from
`r f(100*last_yr_base_model$mcmccalcs$dmed["2024"], 1)`% in last year's model to
`r f(100*base_model$mcmccalcs$dmed["2024"], 1)`% this year as a result
of removing the age-1 index and associated changes to recruitment estimates (e.g.,
reduced estimate of the 2018 and 2022 year classes).

The `r sp` stock displays a very high degree of recruitment variability,
perhaps the largest of any west coast groundfish stock, resulting in large and
rapid biomass changes. This volatility, coupled with a dynamic fishery that
potentially targets strong cohorts (resulting in time-varying selectivity)
will in most circumstances continue to result in highly uncertain
estimates of current stock status and even less-certain projections of the
stock trajectory. This is particularly true for female spawning biomass
estimates in `r assess_yr` and throughout the current forecast period, because
there is considerable uncertainty associated with the absolute size of the, now
mostly mature, 2020 and 2021 year classes that propagates into forecasts. Although
the 2023 acoustic survey helped to refine these estimates and reduce uncertainty,
further observations of these year classes will improve estimates. The removal of
recruitment deviation estimates from 2023 onward through the forecast period led to
an underestimation of uncertainty during the forecast period.

Uncertainty measures in the base model underestimate the total uncertainty in
the current stock status and projections, because they do not account for
alternative structural models for hake population dynamics and fishery
processes (e.g., recruitment, selectivity, or spatial fleet or population
structure), the effects of alternative data-weighting choices, survey
catchability, and the scientific basis for prior probability distributions. To
address structural uncertainties, the JTC investigated a range of alternative
models, and we present the key sensitivity analyses along with other
informative sensitivity analyses using full MCMC results
(Section~\@ref(sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses)).

The JTC continues to be committed to advancing MSE analyses, by coordinating
research with the `r sp` MSE Working Group and other scientists in the region
engaged in similar research. Incorporating feedback from the
Working Group and stakeholders will ensure that operating models will be able
to provide insight into the important questions defined by interested parties.
Specifically, the development of MSE tools will evaluate major sources of
uncertainty relating to data, model structure and the harvest policy for this
fishery, and will compare potential methods to address them. In the coming
years, this will include a host of research evaluations (see
Section~\@ref(sec:assessment-response-review) and
Section~\@ref(sec:research)), including evaluating the utility of
incorporating environmentally-driven age-0 recruitment indices into the stock
assessment.

## Reference points {#sec:assessment-reference-points}

The term 'reference points' is used throughout this document to describe
common conceptual summary metrics. The Agreement specifically identifies
`r fspr_40` as the default harvest rate and `r b_40` as a point where the
40:10 TAC adjustment is triggered (see the Glossary in
Appendix~\@ref(sec:app-glossary)).

We report estimates of the base reference points (e.g., `r fspr_40`, `r b_40`,
`r b_msy`, and MSY) with posterior credibility intervals in
Table~\@ref(tab:main-reference-points-tab). The median of the female spawning
biomass at `r fspr_40` (namely the median of `r bspr_40`) and the median yield
at `r fspr_40` have declined slightly from the estimates in the
`r last_assess_yr` assessment (Table~\@ref(tab:main-parameter-estimates-tab)).

As part of the DFO Sustainable Fisheries Framework, @DFO2009 defined a limit
reference point as being a biomass below which serious harm is believed to be
occurring to the stock, and an upper stock reference point above which the
stock is considered to be healthy. These would equate to the Agreement
reference points of `r b_10` and `r b_40` (the female spawning biomass being
10% and 40%, respectively, of the unfished equilibrium female spawning
biomass). The probabilities of the female spawning biomass at the start of
`r assess_yr` being above each of these points are
P(*B*~`r assess_yr`~ > `r b_10`) = `r probs_curr_b10`% and
P(*B*~`r assess_yr`~ > `r b_40`) = `r probs_curr_b40`%
such that the stock is estimated to be in the 'healthy zone' (above the upper
stock reference point of `r b_40`). This probability is slightly lower than in
last year's assessment, where the equivalent calculation was
P(*B*~`r assess_yr - 1`~ > `r b_40`) = 98.1%. Note that a probability
of '100%' (or '0%') is based on the MCMC results, and is not meant to imply
that something definitely occurs (or definitely does not occur).

With respect to DFO's provisional limit reference point of 0.4`r b_msy` and
provisional upper stock reference point of 0.8`r b_msy`, the probabilities are
P(*B*~`r assess_yr`~ > 0.4`r b_msy`) = `r f(pull(dfo_probs_curr[1, 2]), 1)`%
and
P(*B*~`r assess_yr`~ > 0.8`r b_msy`) = `r f(pull(dfo_probs_curr[1, 3]), 1)`%
such that the stock is estimated to be in the provisional `healthy zone'.
For completeness, we note that
P(*B*~`r assess_yr`~ > `r b_msy`) = `r f(pull(dfo_probs_curr[1, 1]), 1)`%.

Reference levels of stock status that are used by the U.S. Pacific Fisheries
Management Council (PFMC) for `r sp` include `r b_40` and a Minimum Stock
Size Threshold (MSST) of `r b_25`. For `r min(forecast_yrs)`, the
estimated posterior median relative spawning biomass is
`r curr_depl_median`%, such that the female spawning biomass is well above
`r b_40` and `r b_25`. The probability that female spawning biomass
at the beginning of `r assess_yr` is above `r b_40` is
P(*B*~`r assess_yr`~ > `r b_40`) = `r probs_curr_b40`% (as noted
above), and of being above `r b_25` is
P(*B*~`r assess_yr`~ > `r b_25`) = `r probs_curr_b25`%.

## Model projections {#sec:assessment-model-projections}

The catch limit for `r min(forecast_yrs)` based on the default `r f_40_40_10`
harvest policy has a median of `r ct_limit_quantiles["median"]`~t and a wide
range of uncertainty (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-projected-catch-density-fig)),
with the 95% credibility interval being `r ct_limit_quantiles["lower"]`--
`r ct_limit_quantiles["upper"]`~t.

Decision tables give projected population status (relative spawning biomass
and relative fishing intensity) under different catch alternatives for the base
model
(Tables~\@ref(tab:main-decisions-biomass-tab) and
\@ref(tab:main-decisions-spr-tab)). The tables are organized such that the
projected outcome for each potential catch level and year (each row) can be
evaluated across the quantiles (columns) of the posterior distribution.
Table~\@ref(tab:main-decisions-biomass-tab) shows
projected relative spawning biomass outcomes, and
Table~\@ref(tab:main-decisions-spr-tab) shows projected fishing intensity
outcomes relative to `r fspr_40`.

Population dynamics and governing parameters assumed during the forecast
period include posterior recruitments taken from the stock-recruitment curve;
selectivity, weight-at-age and maturity (and thus fecundity) averaged over the
five most recent years (`r assess_yr - 5`--`r assess_yr - 1`); and all
estimated parameters constant (at their estimates for each particular MCMC
sample).

Relative fishing intensity exceeding 1 (or 100% when shown as a percentage)
indicates fishing in excess of the `r fspr_40` default harvest rate limit.
It is possible for values in forecast years to exceed this slightly because
the `r fspr_40` default harvest-rate catch limit is calculated using
baseline selectivity-at-age (`r start_yr`--1990; prior to time-varying
deviations), whereas the forecasted catches under the default harvest-rate
are removed using selectivity averaged over the last five years. Recent
changes in selectivity could be reflected in the projection of slight over-
or under-fishing relative to the desired `r fspr_40` rate.

Key management metrics are presented for
`r forecast_yrs[2]` and `r forecast_yrs[3]` projections
(Tables~\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-1-tab)--
\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-2-tab) and
Figures~\@ref(fig:main-risk-year-1-fig)--
\@ref(fig:main-risk-year-2-fig)). These metrics summarize
the probability of various outcomes from the base model given each potential
management action. Although not linear, probabilities can be interpolated
from this table for intermediate catch values in `r assess_yr`
(Table~\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-1-tab) and
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-risk-year-1-fig)). However,
interpolation may not be applicable for all catches in `r assess_yr + 1`
because they are conditional on catch levels from the
previous year or years.

Figure~\@ref(fig:main-depletion-comparison-fig) shows the projected
relative spawning biomass trajectory through
`r forecast_yrs[length(forecast_yrs)]` for several of these management
actions. With zero catch for the next two years, the biomass has a
`r zero_catch_prob_bio_down_1`% probability of decreasing from
`r forecast_yrs[1]` to `r forecast_yrs[2]`
(Table~\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-1-tab) and
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-risk-year-1-fig)) and a
`r zero_catch_prob_bio_down_2`% probability of decreasing from
`r forecast_yrs[2]` to `r forecast_yrs[3]`
(Table~\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-2-tab) and
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-risk-year-2-fig)).
<!--and a `r zero_catch_prob_bio_down_3`% probability of decreasing from-->
<!--`r forecast_yrs[3]` to `r forecast_yrs[4]`-->
<!--(Table~\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-3-tab)-->
<!--and Figure~\@ref(fig:main-risk-year-3-fig)).-->

The probability of the female spawning biomass decreasing from `r end_yr` to
`r end_yr + 1` is greater or equal to `r prob_all_catch_greater`% for all catch
levels examined other than zero (Table~\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-1-tab) and
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-risk-year-1-fig)). For all explored catches, the
maximum probability of the female spawning biomass dropping below `r b_10`
at the start of `r end_yr + 1` is
`r prob_max_below_10_yr1`% and at the start of `r end_yr + 2` is
`r prob_max_below_10_yr2`%
<!--and at the start of `r end_yr + 3` is-->
<!--`r prob_max_below_10_yr3`%-->
(Tables~\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-1-tab)--\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-2-tab) and
Figures~\@ref(fig:main-risk-year-1-fig)--
\@ref(fig:main-risk-year-2-fig)). The similar maximum
probability of dropping below `r b_40` at the start of `r end_yr + 1` is
`r prob_max_below_40_yr1`% and at the start of `r end_yr + 2` is
`r prob_max_below_40_yr2`%.
<!--and at the start of `r end_yr + 3`-->
<!--is `r prob_max_below_40_yr3`%.-->
The model estimates that in two years
time the stock will be at `r b_40` with a catch
of 250,000~t in 2026 and 2027, given the current assumption of median recruitment
from 2023 onward.

It should be noted that forecasted biomass is not only influenced by catch
levels. As the above average 2014 and 2016 cohorts continue to age, total
biomass of these cohorts even without fishing mortality will continue to
decrease (Tables~\@ref(tab:main-est-biomass-at-age-tab) and
\@ref(tab:main-cohort-effects-tab)) as losses from mortality outweigh
increases from growth. The above-average 2021 cohort entered this
growth-mortality transition period around 2024
(Tables~\@ref(tab:main-est-biomass-at-age-tab) and
\@ref(tab:main-cohort-effects-tab)).
The 2021 cohort will play a large role in determining female spawning
biomass during the forecast years presented here. Similarly, the application
of no recruitment deviations from 2023 onwards also plays a major role in forecasted
female spawning biomass levels. The below-average 2015,
2018, and 2019 cohorts will contribute much less to forecasted spawning
biomass than the larger cohorts. 

The age composition (in numbers) of the catch in `r forecast_yrs[1]` is
projected to be (using MCMC medians)
`r fore_catch_prop[["4"]]`% age-4 fish from the `r forecast_yrs[1] - 4` cohort,
`r fore_catch_prop[["5"]]`% age-5 fish from the `r forecast_yrs[1] - 5` cohort,
`r fore_catch_prop[["9"]]`% age-9 fish from the `r forecast_yrs[1] - 9` cohort,
and
`r fore_catch_prop[["11"]]`% age-11 fish from the `r forecast_yrs[1] - 11` cohort
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-age-comp-forecast-fig)). However, those estimates
are highly uncertain with the 95% credibility interval for the age-4 fraction
spanning `r f(fore_catch_prop_age4_lower)`%--
`r f(fore_catch_prop_age4_upper)`%.

Due to the higher average weight of older fish compared to younger fish, the
median expected proportion of the `r forecast_yrs[1]` catch by weight
is `r f(fore_catch_prop_wt_age4_median)`% for the age-4
`r forecast_yrs[1] - 4` cohort (compared to `r fore_catch_prop[["4"]]`% by
numbers) and `r f(fore_catch_prop_wt_age11_median)`%
for the large age-11 `r forecast_yrs[1] - 11` cohort
(compared to `r fore_catch_prop[["11"]]`% by numbers;
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-age-comp-forecast-fig)).

With respect to the DFO reference points, with the largest
`r assess_yr` catch of `r largest_next_catch`~t given in
Table~\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-1-tab), at the start of `r assess_yr + 1` the
stock is expected to be above the critical zone with a probability of
P(*B*~`r assess_yr + 1`~ > `r b_10`) = `r prob_next_over_b10`%
and in the healthy zone with a probability of
P(*B*~`r assess_yr + 1`~ > `r b_40`) = `r prob_next_over_b40`%.
With respect to the DFO provisional reference points (based on `r b_msy`), the
stock is expected to be above the provisional critical zone with a probability
of
P(*B*~`r assess_yr + 1`~ > 0.4`r b_msy`) = `r dfo_prob_next_over_40bmsy`%,
in the healthy zone with a probability of
P(*B*~`r assess_yr + 1`~ > 0.8`r b_msy`) = `r dfo_prob_next_over_80bmsy`%,
and above `r b_msy` with a probability of
P(*B*~`r assess_yr + 1`~ > `r b_msy`) = `r dfo_prob_next_over_bmsy`% for
this catch.

With respect to PFMC stock size reference points, a level of `r assess_yr`
catch consistent with the Agreement default harvest control rule
(`r next_treaty_catch`~t) has a `r pfmc_prob_next_yr_below_b40`% estimated
probability of resulting in the biomass going below `r b_40` at the start of
`r assess_yr + 1` (and `r pfmc_prob_next_yr_below_b25`% probability of going
below `r b_25`; Table~\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-1-tab)).

## Sensitivity analyses {#sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate influence of data inputs
and structural uncertainty of the base model by investigating how changes to
the model affected the estimated values and derived quantities. All
sensitivity analyses compared MCMC posteriors with the same number of posterior
samples as the base model. Several key underlying structural model assumptions
were identified that have persisted across many previous hake assessments, and
thus warrant revisiting annually as a set of reference sensitivity examinations
to new base models. Many additional sensitivity runs were conducted while
developing and testing the `r assess_yr` base model. Here we focus on the main
sensitivities, relative to the base model, which are as follows:

1. Consideration of higher standard deviations on the prior distribution for
natural mortality;

1. Consideration of an alternative prior distribution (mean and standard
deviation) for natural mortality based on the @Hamel2015 and @HamelCope2022
life-history meta-analytic method;

1. Consideration of an alternative prior distribution and a fixed value for
steepness, to change the resiliency of the stock;

1. Consideration of higher and lower variation about the stock--recruitment
relationship ($\sigma_r$);

1. Addition of the relative age-1 index as a data source;

1. Down weighting the fishery age-composition data;

1. Consideration of alternative standard deviations for time-varying
selectivity;

1. Addition of a relative index of abundance based on environmental-DNA;

1. Using the middle of the year to predict maturity-at-age data; and

1. Assuming $M$ is specific to ages 0--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6$^+$.

Most of the sensitivities resulted in a similar trajectory of the population
dynamics as the base model
(Tables~\@ref(tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1-tab)--
\@ref(tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-3-tab) and
Figures~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1-fig)--
\@ref(fig:main-mortality-sens-fig)), with the largest deviations occurring
in the sensitivities related to natural mortality.
All sensitivity models matched the base model in terms of trends from the start
of the model to approximately 2020, e.g., increases in female spawning biomass
in the early- to mid-2010s driven by the 2010, 2014, and 2016 cohorts, followed
by a period of general decline during a period of high catches. Some of the
models differed from the base model in their trajectories of recent trends and
unfished levels.
All sensitivity models, except when age-specific natural mortality was fixed,
indicate that `r assess_yr` median estimate of relative spawning biomass is
above `r b_40`. As previously mentioned, the overall scale of the population was
impacted by various alternative assumptions, and the uncertainty about size of
the recent cohorts was more variable across sensitivity analyses than earlier
cohorts that have been observed for more years.

The standard deviation of the prior distribution on natural mortality was
increased from the base model value of 0.1 to 0.2, 0.3, and 0.31. Note that
the median of the prior was also changed for the latter sensitivity due to the
use of the @HamelCope2022 prior. Estimates of natural mortality were higher than
the base model for each of these changes to the prior. The medians of the MCMC
osteriors for natural mortality increased from `r f(nat_m[2], 3)` to
`r f_nat_m_02[2]`, `r f_nat_m_03[2]`, and `r f_nat_m_hamel[2]`, respectively.
The 95% credibility intervals also increased, with the largest differences
in the upper end rather than the lower end of the intervals. The credible
interval for the base model was
`r f(nat_m[1], 3)`--`r f(nat_m[3], 3)`, and for the sensitivity runs were
`r f_nat_m_02[1]`--`r f_nat_m_02[3]`,
`r f_nat_m_03[1]`--`r f_nat_m_03[3]` , and
`r f_nat_m_hamel[1]`--`r f_nat_m_hamel[3]`,
respectively, (Table~\@ref(tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1-tab)).
In addition to increased estimates of natural mortality, results from these
sensitivity models also showed increases in the overall scale of the
population, the estimated stock status relative to `r b_0` prior to 1990, and
the uncertainty in female spawning biomass on both absolute and relative scales.
They also led to roughly a halving of the estimated relative fishing intensity
in `r end_yr - 1` and roughly a doubling of equilibrium yield at `r bspr_40`
(Table~\@ref(tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1-tab) and
Figures~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1-fig) and
\@ref(fig:main-status-base-alternative-1-fig)).

The mean of the prior distribution on steepness was decreased from 0.777
to 0.5 and, separately, steepness was fixed at 1.0. The decrease in
the mean of the prior resulted in a decrease in the median estimate of steepness
from `r f(steep[2], 3)` (`r f(steep[1], 3)`--`r f(steep[3], 3)`) to
`r f_steep_prior_05[2]` (`r f_steep_prior_05[1]`--`r f_steep_prior_05[3]`;
Table~\@ref(tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1-tab)). However, neither
sensitivity analysis had a large impact on the overall model results
(Figures~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1-fig) and
\@ref(fig:main-status-base-alternative-1-fig)), because `r sp` female spawning
biomass has remained above levels where changes in steepness would appreciably
influence the stock--recruitment relationship
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-stock-recruitment-fig)).

The fixed value for $\sigma_r$ was changed from `r sigma_r` to
alternative low (`r sigma_r_sens[1]`) and high (`r sigma_r_sens[2]`) states.
Both sensitivities led to results that were similar to the base model and higher
calculated standard deviation of recruitment deviations (from the main period)
than the fixed value used in the analysis, i.e., when $\sigma_r$ was
`r sigma_r_sens[1]` the calculated value was `r sigma_r_lo_main` and when
$\sigma_r$ was `r sigma_r_sens[2]` the calculated value was `r sigma_r_hi_main`.
For the base model, the calculated standard deviation of the recruitment
deviations was intermediate with a median of `r sigma_r_this_year_main`. These
calculated standard deviations should match the input if the vectors of
deviations were from the `population' of values rather than just a sample.
A systematic bias larger than the input value indicates that
the standard deviation of recruitment deviations is accounting for more
variability than just variability in recruitment. The high $\sigma_r$ model led
to a larger difference between the female spawning biomass at unfished
equilibrium and the female spawning biomass at the initial year of the model
than the low $\sigma_r$ model
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1-fig)). Similar to previous
assessments, estimates of unfished equilibrium recruitment are sensitive to
$\sigma_r$, whereas absolute estimates of female spawning biomass are relatively
insensitive. The method that
@MethotTaylor2011 proposed to tune $\sigma_r$ was developed in the context of
maximum likelihood estimation and not Bayesian inference, where the latter
potentially allows for estimating $\sigma_r$ using random effects, and thus,
this proposed method is not used here to tune the fixed input value.

The sensitivity of the base model to the addition of the relative age-1 index
provides a method to evaluate how the information about juvenile fish is
propagated through the model. Estimates of female spawning biomass throughout
most of the time series are similar between models with and without the relative
age-1 index, which starts in 1995, but start to noticeably diverge in 2017
(Table~\@ref(tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1-tab),
Figures~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2-fig) and
\@ref(fig:main-status-base-alternative-2-fig)). The `r end_yr` estimates of
relative spawning biomass are `r f(100 * bratio_curr[2], 1)`% for the base model
(95% credible interval of `r f(100 * bratio_curr[1], 1)`--
`r f(100 * bratio_curr[3], 1)`%) and `r f(100 * bratio_age1[2], 1)`%
for the model where the relative age-1 index is included (95% credible interval of
`r f(100 * bratio_age1[1], 1)`--`r f(100 * bratio_age1[3], 1)`%). This
difference is due to the relative age-1 index providing additional information on
recruitment for cohorts associated with recent age-1 indices (i.e., 2020 and
2022 cohorts detected in the 2021 and 2023 age-1 indices). In particular, the
sensitivity with the relative age-1 index indicates slightly larger 2020 and
2021 year classes than the base model without the relative age-1 index
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-base-alternative-2-fig)). Similarly,
recruitment in 2022 is estimated to be somewhat larger for the model with the
relative age-1 index than the base model, though both median recruitment
deviations are negative.
Adding the relative age-1 index led to changes in fit to the
age-2$+$ survey biomass index. Both models underestimate the 2021 age-2$+$ index
(the base model more so), and both overestimate the 2023 age-2$+$ (the base model
less so; Figure~\@ref(fig:main-index-base-alternative-2-fig)). The
inclusion of the age-1 index leads to higher estimates of female spawning
biomass in recent years compared to the base model.

The base model includes a Dirichlet-multinomial likelihood component that
includes two estimated parameters to automatically weight the fishery and
survey age compositions. The base model was compared to a model that
down weighted the fishery age compositions relative to the survey age
compositions. This down weighting was based on the McAllister--Ianelli method,
which requires manual iterative adjustments to the input sample sizes using a
derived multiplier. The McAllister--Ianelli method, which was used in
assessments prior to 2018 (Table~\@ref(tab:main-assessment-changes-tab)),
attempts to make the arithmetic mean of the input sample size approximately
equal to the harmonic mean of the effective sample size. Here, this was
accomplished with weighting factors of 0.14 and 0.46 (ratio of 0.30) for fishery and survey
age compositions, respectively. These weighting factors are not specific to this
year's base model because an iterative process is not possible when using
Bayesian inference, rather they are values calculated from previous maximum
likelihood estimates. The median estimate from the Dirichlet-multinomial
method used in the base model was `r f(dm_weight_fishery_median, 3)` and
`r f(dm_weight_survey_median, 3)`, respectively (ratio of
`r f(as.numeric(dm_weight_fishery_median) / as.numeric(dm_weight_survey_median), 2)`).
Down weighting fishery composition data led to minor changes in relative
spawning biomass, recruitment estimates, and increased uncertainty in estimates
of early recruitment deviations compared to the base model
(Figures~\@ref(fig:main-status-base-alternative-2-fig) and
\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-base-alternative-2-fig)). The majority of these
changes were realized in the 1980s but estimates of female spawning biomass in
the most recent years were also different between these two models. In particular,
estimates of female spawning biomass in the most recent four years indicated
less recovery of the population when fishery-age composition data were down
weighted.

A biomass-based index of `r sp` relative abundance has been developed using
environmental DNA (see Appendix~\@ref(sec:app-eDNA-index)) that covers
the years
`r sens_models[[2]][[4]][["cpue"]] |> dplyr::filter(grepl("edna", Fleet_name, ignore.case = TRUE), Use > 0) |> dplyr::pull(Yr) |> glue::glue_collapse(sep = ", ", last = ", and ")`.
The index was specified as having
a Student’s t-distribution for the error structure (similar to the
sensitivity with the relative age-1 index) with
`r sens_models[[2]][[4]][["dat"]][["CPUEinfo"]] |> tibble::rownames_to_column() |> dplyr::filter(grepl("edna", rowname, ignore.case = TRUE)) |> dplyr::pull(errtype)` degrees of freedom given that
there are
`r sens_models[[2]][[4]][["cpue"]] |> dplyr::filter(grepl("edna", Fleet_name, ignore.case = TRUE), Use > 0) |> NROW()`
data points in the time series. An additional constant and additive
standard deviation on the log-scale to accommodate
unaccounted-for sources of process and observation error was determined unneccessary.
The index is representative of all fish age-1 and older, with a median estimate
of catchability of
`r f(as.numeric(exp(sens_models[[2]][[4]]$extra_mcmc$lnq_edna_med)), 3)`.
Catchability is not as intuitive as for the other indices as it scales copies of
DNA per microliter to biomass. The eDNA index declined from 2019 to 2023, though
more steeply between 2019 to 2021 than between 2021 and 2023
(see Figure~\@ref(fig:app-eDNA-index-1-fig)). The eDNA index is
fit well in the model (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-index-edna-fig)),
somewhat at the cost of reduced fits to the age-composition data. While the
inclusion of the eDNA index did not significantly alter most key parameters and
management quantities (Table~\@ref(tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-2-tab)),
it did lead to reductions in estimates of female spawning biomass from 2021
onward, similar to when fishery age-composition data are
down weighted
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2-fig)). The eDNA index was
included here as an initial exploration and proof-of-concept. Further explorations
are needed, such as integrating eDNA data with acoustic data outside the assessment model
to produce more accurate and robust survey estimates, before it should be used
for management advice. The construction of a longer time series, through continued
eDNA sampling, will be advantageous for understanding `r sp` population
dynamics and the biological communities that interact with `r sp`.

Changing the day of year that maturity was predicted to from
`r maturity_estimates_df |> dplyr::pull(doy) |> unique() |> max()` to
`r maturity_estimates_df |> dplyr::pull(doy) |> unique() |> min()`
led to decreases in estimates of female spawning biomass for the majority of the
time series except for the terminal year. Estimates of unfished spawning biomass
were also lower for this model
(Table~\@ref(tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-2-tab),
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2-fig)), and thus estimates of 
relative biomass are similar between this sensitivity and the base model
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-status-base-alternative-2-fig)).

The degree of flexibility of annual variation in the fishery selectivity was
tested using three alternative values of standard deviations ($\Phi$)
(Figures~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-4-fig)--
\@ref(fig:main-index-base-alternative-4-fig)). The consideration of alternative
$\Phi$ values is discussed earlier in
Section~\@ref(sec:data-variability-selectivity). Changing $\Phi$, which
controls the flexibility in time-varying selectivity, from
the base model value of $\Phi = 1.40$ to 0.21, 0.70, and 2.10 did not
appreciably influence the estimates, or precision, associated with recruitment
in 2014 or 2016 but it did impact more recent estimates of recruitment
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-base-alternative-4-fig)). Changes in
estimates of recruitment did not linearly scale with the changes in $\Phi$ and
patterns were not consistent across years. For example, in 2011 higher $\Phi$
values led to higher estimates of recruitment but for the 2021 estimate of
recruitment a \$Phi$ of 0.70 led to the lowest estimate
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-devs-base-alternative-4-fig)).
The higher estimates of recruitment for $\Phi = 0.21$ led to a large increase in female spawning
biomass in recent years compared to the base model due to the pattern in recruitment
estimates. Estimates of terminal female spawning biomass decrease as $\Phi$
changes from 0.21 to 2.1 to 1.4 to 0.7.
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-4-fig)).
When $\Phi = 0.21$, the fit to the most recent age-2$+$ survey biomass index
was the worst of the three investigated models
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-index-base-alternative-4-fig)).

Cannibalistic mortality at age since 1993 was estimated using CEATTLE
[@HolsmanEtAl2016] and input into the assessment as fixed values.
These annual deviations were available for six groups of fish, age-1 fish and younger,
age-2 fish, age-3 fish, age-4 fish, age-5 fish, and fish ages six and older. The
annual deviations were used the following sensitivities related to specifying
natural mortality at age rather than time-invariant and age-invariant natural
mortality, like what is in the base model. The first sensitivity
estimated baseline mortality for each age group, while the second
sensitivity fixed baseline mortality at 0.13 for all groups based on the
estimate of baseline mortality from CEATTLE. Given the time-varying age-specific
deviations, mortality was, on average, more than 20 times larger for age-1 fish
than any other age. Age-2 fish also experienced more cannibalism than older
fish in most years but estimates of cannibalism were higher for age-3 than
age-2 fish in some years (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-mortality-sens-fig)). Cannibalism
for fish age six and above was zero in all years. The annual age-specific
deviations were estimated by fitting CEATTLE to diet data up to 2019.
More recent diet data exists but it has yet to be analyzed and included in the regional
database for its use in CEATTLE. Age-0 and age-1 fish were found in over 7,000
stomachs of the 17,000 `r sp` stomachs analyzed. Additionally, CEATTLE is informed by temperature at 130 m
depth from GLORYS output at the same spatial footprint of the acoustic survey.
More details about fitting data on `r sp` to CEATTLE can be found
in @WassermannEtAl2025.

Estimates of spawning biomass and other derived quantities were quite similar
when baseline natural mortality was estimated
(Figures~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-5-fig)--
\@ref(fig:main-index-base-alternative-5-fig)), with the largest differences seen
in the mid-1980s and in the terminal years where the deviations are the highest
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-mortality-sens-fig)). Notably, estimates of spawning
biomass decreased to near target levels when baseline natural mortality was
fixed at 0.13 for all ages. The uncertainty in almost all estimated
quantities decreased when baseline mortality was fixed.
Estimates of recruitment deviations were smaller for the initial period and
larger for the main period, though the differences were relatively small, when
age-specific natural mortality was not estimated compared to the other two
models (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-devs-base-alternative-5-fig)).

## Retrospective analyses {#sec:assessment-retrospective-analyses}

Retrospective analyses were performed by iteratively removing the terminal
year data used to fit the model until ten years of data were removed
Table~\@ref(tab:main-parameter-estimates-retro-tab). Retrospective analyses are
informative for identifying consistent under- and over-estimation of estimates,
particularly for spawning biomass and recruitment deviations.

As more information is gained regarding large cohorts, the estimated strength
of the cohort tends to decrease
(Figures~\@ref(fig:main-retrospective-recruitment-fig)
and~\@ref(fig:main-retrospective-recruitment-2-fig)).
In this assessment, the previous trend was true for both large (positive) and
small (negative) recruitment deviations, where all cohorts except the 2016 and
2018 cohorts were estimated to be smaller with time. For cohorts that have
positive recruitment deviations, such as the 2014 cohort, the uncertainty is
narrower around the median due to a higher sampling rate over the years than the
cohorts with negative recruitments such as the 2015 cohort.

The retrospective plots in this year's assessment look slightly different
than those from previous assessments; recruitment deviations for the last two
years of the time series plus the assessment year are fixed at zero.

The latest data confirm that 2020 is not likely to be an extremely large cohort
(Figures~\@ref(fig:main-retrospective-recruitment-fig)
and~\@ref(fig:main-retrospective-recruitment-2-fig)). The 2021 cohort at
age-3 had a lower median than the 2020 cohort at age-3 but did not decrease as
much as the 2020 cohort at age 4. Confirming cohort strengths for even-numbered
recruitment years takes longer than for odd-numbered recruitment years because
the survey does not include them in the age-2$+$ survey until they are of age
three. Almost all estimates of recruitment deviations, positive or negative,
stabilize by the age of six
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-relative-retrospective-recruitment-fig)).

The stability of the recruitment estimates seen in
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-retrospective-recruitment-fig) is also evident
in the absolute estimates of uncertainty for each cohort. Uncertainty in
biomass for cohorts from 2014--2023 has been substantially reduced in the
`r assess_yr` base model compared to removing 1--5 years of data
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-recruitment-retrospective-fig), upper and
lower panels).

Overall, there is little retrospective change to the relative spawning biomass
trajectory up to the mid-2010s, and most retrospective change occurs in the
final 5 years of the retrospective model
(upper panel of Figure~\@ref(fig:main-biomass-recruitment-retrospective-fig)).
The most change in spawning biomass occurs when two years of data are removed
because of changes in the estimate of absolute recruitment in 2020 to a much
larger recruitment event compared to the base model. The large positive
recruitment event is not present in the three-year peel of data when the terminal-year
estimates are again informed by both fishery and survey data. Except for the
previously explained changes, there is very little retrospective bias, with only
slight year-specific positive bias in female spawning biomass, some minor
adjustments to recruitment deviates, and a slight negative trend in `r b_0` as the
retrospective year increases.

## Comparison with past assessments {#sec:assessment-past-assessments}

A comparison of the base models, approved for management, used in each year
since `r min(assess_history_df$yr, na.rm = TRUE)` indicates that the
variability between model results, especially early on in the estimated time
series, is larger than the estimated uncertainty reported from the current base model
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-historical-assessments-fig)). There have been substantial
differences in the structural assumptions of the models and, thus, results
submitted each year. Prior to 2004, catchability was fixed at 1.0. This
assumption was investigated between 2004 and 2007, leading to variability in
model results because of the use of several different, but fixed, values of
catchability. Since 2008, catchability has been freely estimated by the model
($q_b$ = `r f(median(base_model$extra_mcmc$q_vector), 2)`). The fixing
of survey catchability had the effect of driving the estimate of initial
biomass upward, which in turn scaled the entire biomass trajectory up,
leading to higher estimates of relative spawning biomass than in more recent
assessments. The median estimates of female spawning biomass for 2016 and 2017
have remained similar to the previous assessment, being somewhat lower than in the
2016 and 2017 assessments. In addition to more
information about the 2014 and 2016 cohorts, the 2018 assessment model also
included a change in the data weighting method, an update to maturity and
fecundity, and a change to selectivity parameterization
(Table~\@ref(tab:main-assessment-changes-tab)). From 2022 to 2024, the relative
age-1 index was used to inform cohort size at an early age.  The age-1 index
was removed in the 2025 assessment. While there was a significant change from
this assessment to the previous one (see Section~\@ref(sec:assessment-changes)),
the uncertainty interval associated with the `r end_yr` assessment brackets
the majority of the historical estimates.

The level of uncertainty associated with each assessment's estimate of that
year's current female spawning biomass (i.e., that used to convey current
stock status and inform management advice) changes from assessment to
assessment given updates in data and `r sp` population structure and
dynamics. Uncertainty around the absolute amount of `r assess_yr` female
spawning biomass is similar to the final-year estimates from previous
assessments, with both absolute interquartile range and the relative amount of
dispersion (or variability relative to the
stock size; similar to a coefficient of variation) consistent with
previous assessments (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-historical-dispersion-fig)).

## Performance of past projections {#sec:assessment-past-projections}

Without rigorous simulation experiments it can be difficult to operationally
assess the accuracy of projections in stock assessments because the truth is
never known with 100% certainty. For `r sp`, hindsight comparisons have been
conducted since 2021 [@JTC2021] to evaluate performance of projections
provided in decision tables (such as Tables~\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-1-tab)
and~\@ref(tab:main-risk-year-2-tab)) of past assessments relative to updated
assessments. Overall, results indicate that assessment model projections give
a relatively good idea of general projected trends and status.

As an example, the 2019 assessment [@JTC2019] gave the estimated probability
of the female spawning biomass declining in the subsequent year,
i.e., P(*B*~2020~ < *B*~2019~), for several possible catches
in 2019, such as 0~t, 180,000~t, 350,000~t, 410,000~t etc. Now that we 'know'
the catch in 2019 was 411,635~t, we can select the 410,000~t row (close
enough to 411,635~t) in the table from the 2019 assessment to give that
assessment's
P(*B*~2020~<*B*~2019~) = `r prob_decline_from_2019_to_2020_historic`%;
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-historical-1-fig). We can also calculate this probability
from the current assessment model (being the most up-to-date picture we have of
stock dynamics) which implicitly includes the
411,635~t catch from 2019, giving
P(*B*~2020~ < *B*~2019~) = `r prob_decline_from_2019_to_2020_curr`%;
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-historical-1-fig). We extracted similar probabilities
from past assessment documents going back to 2012 and calculate analogous
probabilities,
P(*B*~t+1~ < *B*~t~), from the current base model
[Figure~\@ref(fig:main-historical-1-fig); see @JTC2022 for full methods].

Each assessment correctly predicted whether the stock would most likely
increase or decrease the following year, except for 2017 and 2023
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-historical-1-fig)). Estimates from previous assessments
are almost always closer to 50% than those from the current base model
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-historical-1-fig)), because the current assessment model
has more information and thus provides a more definitive probability (closer
to 0% or to 100%) than year $t$'s assessment model. It is desirable that the
probabilities from the assessment documents are not too definitive (too close
to 0% or to 100%), because they are admitting a wide range of uncertainty
given unknown recent recruitments.

The 2017 and 2023 assessments `incorrectly' projected that the stock would
likely decline the following year (given the catch that subsequently occurred),
because the current assessment model estimates a likely increase
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-historical-1-fig)). For the 2017 [@JTC2017] assessment
the biomass trend was projected to be relatively flat the
following year, so even slight changes in
biomass could influence the binomial outcome of an 'increase' or 'decrease' in
biomass, despite the overall change in biomass not being very substantial.
The
2023 assessment [@JTC2023] had minimal information on the 2021 cohort and
predicted the biomass would probably decline in 2024 with any non-zero 2023
catch. However, the current assessment estimates that the 2021 cohort was
potentially large, which further highlights how impactful a realized large
deviation from average recruitment (rather than assuming average recruitment)
can be on forecasted outcomes. Similarly, the 2012 assessment had no
information on the very large 2010 recruitment, and so also over-estimated
the probability of decline the following year
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-historical-1-fig)). A range of catch alternatives are
shown for the current assessment because realized `r assess_yr` catches are
not yet known (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-historical-1-fig)), and all (including no catch)
suggest the stock will decline from `r assess_yr` to `r assess_yr + 1`.

A similar approach was used to calculate the probability of the biomass
falling below `r b_40` in the subsequent year,
i.e., P(*B*~t+1~ < `r b_40`); Figure~\@ref(fig:main-historical-2-fig).
The 2012 assessment was the only one that gave a >50% chance of the
biomass falling below `r b_40` in the subsequent year, but later data
determined that the 2010 year class was substantial and so in
hindsight the probability of going below `r b_40` was 0% (based on the
current assessment). From the 2016 assessment onwards, the estimated
P(*B*~t+1~ < `r b_40`) probabilities rose, until falling due to the
incoming above-average 2020 cohort and lower catches
(Figure~\@ref(fig:main-historical-2-fig)). The same probabilities calculated
from the current base model similarly rose, but all remained lower than
the previous
assessments' calculations, until being above since 2022 onwards. The
current assessment estimates a probability of 11--12% that the biomass was below
`r b_40` in each of 2023--2025, above the respective probabilities of 8%, 3%,
and 1% estimated in the 2022--2024 assessments.
