# For manual adjustments of captions. Some of the captions will not line up
# perfectly with the header and footer lines. Nudging them a bit left or
# right will line them up perfectly
#
# Note that all these tags have to be in the ORDER IN WHICH THEY APPEAR
# IN THE DOCUMENT! The values are determined by trial-and-error looking at
# the document after it's built
#
# Make sure you prepend the label with tab: for tables and fig: for figures
#
# Column descriptions:
# chunk_label: The knitr chunk label for the chunk which creates the
#   table or figure
# adjustment: Amount in pts to move the caption. A negative number means
#   move it left and positive means move it to the right
