# Scientific Review Group (SRG) requests {#sec:app-srg-requests}

This appendix summarizes results produced in response to Scientific Review
Group requests made during the meeting held from February 10--13, `r assess_yr`.
Full presentations given at the meeting are available by request by contacting
a Joint Technical Committee member (see the Treaty
[website](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/partners/joint-technical-committee-pacific-hake-whiting-treaty)
for current members).

## Day 1

**Request 1**

Conduct a 5-year retrospective for the sensitivity model that removes the age-1 index, with
focus on the 2022 and 2020 year classes.

**JTC Response**

The generated squid plot (Figure~\@ref(fig:main-retrospective-recruitment-fig)) shows that the 2020
cohort has increased uncertainty at age 3 and the 2022 cohort is estimated to be smaller
than the model that included the age-1 survey (not shown).

**Request 2**

Show the fit to survey index for the sensitivity model that removes the age-1 index (replicate
plots from the assessment presentation on slides 16-20) and any other plots the JTC finds to be helpful.

**JTC Response**

All the requested plots were created and shared.  After removing the age-1 index (new base model; Figure~\@ref(fig:main-survey-index-fit-mcmc-fig)), the
trajectory of the expected biomass was reduced, resulting in a poorer fit to the median in 2021
and an improved fit in 2023 (negligible change to the fit in 2019) when compared to
the model with the age-1 index removed (Figure~\@ref(fig:mcmc-survey-fit-srg-app)). Plots of survey and fishery age composition fits showed a very small change
in the survey age composition fit for age-3 fish in 2021. Otherwise, there were
no substantial differences in the age composition fits (figures not shown).

(ref:mcmc-survey-srg-app-fit-cap) Fit to the acoustic survey for the model that excludes the age-1 index (new base model).

(ref:mcmc-survey-srg-app-fit-alt) The fit is similar to the model that includes the age-1 survey except for small differences in 2019 and 2021 and 2023.

                     leg_font_size = 10 / .pt)
```

**Request 3**

Provide plots of selectivity in 2024 as well as mountain plots for sensitivities to removing age-1 index, to the alternative values of phi (deviations for selectivity), and for adding in the eDNA index.

**JTC Response**

A series of figures were produced, including two that showed time-varying selectivity across
all years and the posterior selectivity for the survey and fishery in 2024.
The latter included 1000 draws from the posterior distribution. The set of figures based
on the model that removes that age-1 index are included in the main document because it is
now the base model.  Shown are a representative subset of the requested figures for the other four models
(Figures~\@ref(fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty-srg-app-fig)--\@ref(fig:main-tv-selex-posteriors-fig4-srg-app)).

**Request 4**

As feasible, tomorrow or later in the week, show data on the spatial distribution
of the stock over time (with a focus on the last two years), especially the proportion
of the stock south of the main waters of the US fishery (e.g. 42 degrees N or what
is available). For example from catch rates (CPUE), catches, fraction of groundfish
trawl survey, eDNA from the hydroacoustic survey, and the hydroacoustic survey.

**JTC Response**

In collaboration with several researchers present at the meeting, figures were
presented showing trends in
an integrated (DFO and NOAA) bottom trawl index
(Figure~\@ref(fig:srg-app-btsi-fig)) and the relative proportion by
latitudinal sub-areas (Figure~\@ref(fig:srg-app-btsi2-fig)), which provided
some indication of increasing biomass in California
over recent years.  Additionally, the southern portion of the eDNA index
covering years 2021 and 2023 showed a slight upward trend
(Figure~\@ref(fig:srg-app-edna-fig)). The distribution of
At-Sea (Figure~\@ref(fig:srg-app-pacfem-atsea-fig)) and
Shoreside (Figure~\@ref(fig:srg-app-pacfem-ss-fig)) revenue over recent years indicated a tendency for
the At-Sea fleet to catch fish closer to the southern extent of the fishing grounds in
recent years. There was a more stable distribution for the Shoreside fleet. Additional
information relevant to the request was shown in research presentations contributed
by Owen Liu, Rebecca Thomas, Kristin Marshall, Mary Hunsicker, and Andy Edwards (not shown
here).

## Day 2

**Request 1**

The SRG requests reanalyzing the bottom trawl index such that uncertainty remains
within the range of 0 and 1 given that these are proportions.

**JTC Response**

For completeness, the bottom trawl index was shown with the uncertainty fixed as
requested (not shown here).

**Request 2**

The SRG requests that the bottom trawl index be analyzed with only US data incorporating
2024, and present the proportion of predicted biomass north and south of 42 degrees latitude.

**JTC Response**

Two bottom trawl survey figures were produced to show trends from both north
and south of 42 latitude
(Figures~\@ref(fig:srg-app-btsi3-fig) and \@ref(fig:srg-app-btsi4-fig)).

```


**Request 3**

The SRG requests sensitivities on fishery selectivity parameterization (in the base model) by increasing the maximum age beyond which selectivity is held constant to ages 8, 10, and 12. Present the resulting fishery selectivity (2024 with uncertainty and MCMC traces and individual years with uncertainty), spawning biomass trajectories, fits to the acoustic survey index, and recruitment deviation estimates.

**JTC Response**

The number of active parameters increases considerably when using a maximum age of 6
(base model; 262 parameters) for time-varying selectivity compared to a maximum of age of 8
(333 parameters), 10 (403 parameters), and 12 (473 parameters). A set of figures were produced
to show some key results comparing the models that increase the age at maximum selectivity
(see Figures~\@ref(fig:main-tv-selex-unc-tv8-srg-app-fig)--\@ref(fig:main-recruitment-devs-base-a-srg-app-fig)).

from a subsample of 1,000 draws from the posterior distribution for the
model with a maximum age of 8 for selectivity.

for ages 1 through 6 with a slight increase to age 7 and a large increase to age 8
and above.

from a subsample of 1,000 draws from the posterior distribution for the

**Request 4**

The SRG requests running the base model with the age-1 index, keeping 2023 and beyond recruitment deterministic, and sequentially (backwards in time) removing the age-1 index from the data. Run the base model without the 2023 age-1 index, then without the 2023 and 2021 age-1 indices, then without the 2023, 2021, and 2019 age-1 indices, and then without the 2023, 2021, 2019, 2017, and 2015 age-1 indices. Present spawning biomass trajectories (with unfished equilibrium spawning biomass), recruitment deviation estimates, and fits to the acoustic survey index.

## Day 3

**Request 1**

The SRG requests a run without the age-1 index to be considered as the base model for producing management advice. Please produce the Executive Summary with this model for review on Day 4 of the 2025 SRG meeting.

**JTC Response**

An updated executive summary was provided for review.


**Request 2**

The SRG requests that decision tables and probability tables be produced with 2023 and onward recruitment estimated and incorporating uncertainty. This would be done on the model without the age-1 index.

**JTC Response**

Decision tables and probabilities were provided along with tables of recent spawning biomass and recruitment estimates.
